William Turk, 5 stars ,"I love this Church!  It is a welcoming Church that encourages you to explore your faith instead of dictating what to believe.  This is not just a Sunday Church, but one that works to spread God's love through work.  The music, children's and youth programs are wonderful and I can't say enough kind things about the staff from the head pastor to the custodian.",3 years ago
