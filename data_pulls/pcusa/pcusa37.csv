Kathy Fox, 5 stars ,"The 95th Holiday Waffle Shop was today and it was awesome.  Waffles with Nashville hot chicken were a favorite of course.  Silent auction and a bake sale too.  Looking forward to next year!

The church is so rich in history and the Egyptian Revival architecture is fascinating.  A great church to visit on Sunday or during the Nashville art crawls.",2 years ago
jennie frank, 5 stars ,"I LOVE this church. I got married in this beautifully historic sanctuary, and also was so blessed to use almost all of the building for my wedding portrait. Michael Arwood, the wedding coordinator, was amazing, as well as Dena Swoner, who helped us with the contracts, scheduling, and many other details. The people here are so very kind and welcoming. We would not have wanted anything more for our special day. We also love to come here for speakers and live music. I have met Nadia Bolz-Weber here, as well as some of the most eclectic underground jazz pianists and instrumentalists. Patty Griffin recorded her album 'Downtown Church' in the sanctuary. The acoustics are incredible there and in the chapel. Many other artists have recorded in this sacred space, but the Patty one is extra special because my husband and I claim one of the songs, 'Little Fire' as our song. When we got married, I was able to sing it right where Patty did. And that's just a few of the great things about this church...LOVE. (Photo credit David and Bradley Thomas)",3 years ago

C R, 1 star ,"We purchased tickets for a concert (Bach to Beatles) and were informed at the entry that we need to wear masks. Nobody wears masks anymore. What is the basis for this BS? When we purchased the tickets, there was no mention of any masks. Stay away from this crazies place, and keep your money in your pocket. This is not God’s place.",9 months ago

M Johnson, 5 stars ,"An excellent example of the early architecture of Nashville. I was once given a guided tour by a good friend who worked there. They were very detailed in the explanation of the construction and even more detailed when describing the the future plans for the management of the beautiful and well maintained old structure. And of course there were the other stories
... Actual local truths that had occurred and in some way or another had an impact on the church... Or those almost a little too far fetched and possibly a tad bit frightening at the same time, ones that you sincerely hope are entirely fictional, but know full well in the back of your mind that there is a little bit of truth in every story 😬😳

Of course i don't recall any of it really it was an awful long time ago... And i was a lot younger and maybe didn't pay as much attention as i should have to the truely beautiful and interesting things in life like the history behind the Downtown Presbyterian Church.

So go see some of the old architecture when you're here. They're like a well-kept local secret hidden in plain sight. And please people we've already convinced the poor tourists that peddle taverns are a good 💡 idea, do we have to have a Party 🎉 Fire 🔥 Truck 🚚? Yeah I saw it. 😕It's as real as any of the other constructs in this dimension anyway. 🤷🏽‍♂️ 🤷🏻‍♀️

bill waltz, 4 stars ,"An historical wonder that is well worth maki g time to visit. It is helpful to know the backstory to understand why there is an Egyptian revival building in downtown Nashville, let alone, one that is a Presbyterian church.  There is a small historical display within, that is worth visiting. I am sorry I was not able to be present for Sunday services",3 years ago

Robbie Frame II, 1 star ,"This ""church"" has quickly become a anti-community establishment. Recently, they've placed more Gates and fencing around the church, keeping visitors and others away while placing signs all around their premise ""Private Property No Trespassing"". I've never seen a church closing itself off as much as this one is recently, which speaks volumes for the people inside that run it.",4 years ago
