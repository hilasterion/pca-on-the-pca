I McCormick, 5 stars ,"Hats off to them for not only being a friend of National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) Augusta, but also for hosting a lot of community events. I find that many Protestant congregations like the Methodists, Presbyterians, and Lutheran tend to be a little more progressive when it comes to social justice and doing for the community than sometimes my home Baptist churches. If other denominations are doing it, they are not advertising it well, but Reid Memorial does a good job of announcing their community events with banners placed outside and announcements by website, email, and newspaper to the community so they are always well attended.",3 years ago
