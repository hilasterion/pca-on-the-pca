Summer James, 1 star ,I came here for there NA group. I have never been to such a boring place in my life! There was absolutely no emotion or connection to be found here at all. Nobody tried to help me or talk to me and my family. Everyone just talk one at a time and never talk to each other. If that's the kind of group you want this is the place for you. But when I look for in a AA or NA meeting is connection Fellowship and emotion which is not to be found at this specific NA meeting,4 years ago
