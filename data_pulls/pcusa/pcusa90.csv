Adriana Perez, 3 stars ,"The church is nice but it looks more interesting from the outside than it actually is.  The structure is beautiful but it isn't an impressive church by any means.  It is nice to admire some of the relics and religious artifacts inside (especially the organ), however, it lacks detail.  It was just ok. Free admission, $5 suggested donation",6 months ago
F Ainsa, 5 stars ,Beautiful church and friendly congregation giving tours and explaining the history of their building. Gorgeous and full of symbolism.,7 months ago
Brooke Tiano, 5 stars ,"This church is historical, breath-taking and the people that serve her are a joy to be around. We had the honor of getting married here and it was a dream come true. Rev. Joe Albright and Robbie Boggs are amazing people. The whole wedding process went so smooth and we will hold this church in our hearts forever. We truly felt connected to god here and feel so blessed that we were able to marry in this treasure of a church. If you have a chance to attend a service or tour here, please do not miss out on visiting.
Warmest Thanks and God Bless from the Rasumoff's

They have beautiful hymnals, and sometimes the Children's Choir does performances. If you want to go to an amazing church this is the place to go.❤️ There is also a garden that winds round the church, giving you a scenic walk. If you are planning a visit to St. Augustine, try to squeeze in a visit. It will definitely be worth it.",11 months ago

I loved it here, and I hope future visitors will love it as well.",3 years ago

Will English, 4 stars ,"Dr. Camp is an amazing orator and pastor. The church is very visually impressive as a historic monument in St. Augustine. I do have to complain about the Organist. He or she consistently plays at a deafening volume and more often than not, double the prescribed time for the song. Silent night, the peak of the Christmas Eve candlelight service, is rendered unenjoyable by the rendition played here. Other than the music, beautiful service.",2 years ago

Cassandra G, 4 stars ,"Every time my husband and I walked past this church when visiting St. Augustine, we thought it was a Catholic Cathedral. The copper dome and spires are architecturally beautiful, and so we decided to explore one day and realized it was a Presbyterian church with a massively impressive pipe organ that seemed to overtake the room. Much to our surprise, the docent on duty informed us that Henry Flagler's mausoleum was located on the premises. Wandering over to the direction in which she pointed, we came to a gated entrance to a white room under a stained glass dome with four crypts: Henry's, two wives (one shared with a passed child), and an empty one.  There was something inspiring, and yet disturbing, to be viewing where Henry Flagler was laid to rest. If you are a history or architecture buff, I recommend stopping in.",6 years ago

Kathleen O'Connor, 1 star ,Clerk Paula keeps texting ex husband and claims a mistake - big difference in area codes and name. Does William want to know about this? It's happened nearly a dozen times this year. Terry how's the blue buddah. We have the phone records to prove this!  Also Terry were the Margueritas worth it last text received?  The phone belongs to me and I obviously see the records. Lose the phone number and contact information already!,3 years ago
