Deborah Hickok, 5 stars ,I visited for Easter service. They had bell ringers that opened the service and a brass ensemble with percussion. The organist and choir were wonderful. The pastor was eloquent and the service concluded with Handel's Hallelujah Chorus. Everyone was very warm and welcoming.,3 years ago
