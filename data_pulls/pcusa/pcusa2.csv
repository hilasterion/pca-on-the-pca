Marcus Earnhardt, 5 stars ,Pastors are all well prepared and give good deliveries.  Congregation is friendly and open to visitors.  Music at 8:30 service is as good as anywhere I have been.  Plenty of opportunities to serve in the community also.  A good choice for anyone looking for a Church home!,2 years ago
J & B Boelkins, 3 stars ,Visited this church when my daughter participated in the service for Girl Scout Sunday. Great special music by a HS ensemble. Limited welcoming by church members -- was a bit surprised by that -- unless they knew I was not a permanent visitor -- but that should not matter.,3 years ago
