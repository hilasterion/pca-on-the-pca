Lauren Lucas, 5 stars ,Nice and welcoming church family. Beautiful church with a great choir! Love taking my daughter here. They have a thing towards the beginning of the service where they call the kids down for children's church then you have the option to take them over to the nursery with the other kids and can enjoy service while they are also tended to and having a nice time!,2 years ago
Taryn Alexandros, 3 stars ,"We read online about the historical photography in the back section of the church and wanted to see this exhibit. We had missed it on our first visit to the city a few years ago. We park and walk up to the doors but they were locked. We knocked and knocked but nothing. There was a red bus stop (the hop on/off tourist bus) right there, so they know people may stop by. I checked the hours on the door and we were within  those hours. I'm not sure what was going on. We will have to try again at a later visit.",4 years ago
