Megan Love, 5 stars ,"I’ve been to this church many time over the years, since I was around 7 years old. As someone that isn’t particularly religious, it is usually difficult to find a place where you feel welcome. No matter how much time passes between my visits, I’m always greeted with a smile. There’s just something about stepping onto the red carpet of that beautiful sanctuary that sets my soul at ease. Today’s visit was unfortunately for a Celebration of Life service for a childhood friend, but I couldn’t picture a better place or a more beautiful place to remember her.",4 years ago
