Margaret Truett, 5 stars ,"I have not visited a worship service here, but am using their very nice gym facilities. They have a walking track overlooking a basketball court, and gym equipment of all kinds located in the Christian Life Center. There is ample parking, and according to the wall plaque, it was opened in 2002, so it is fairly new, and very well maintained. The fee is extremely reasonable at $15, and they have exercise and yoga classes also for small additional fees. Highly recommended for seniors!",3 years ago
