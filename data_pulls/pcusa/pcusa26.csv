Alice Rose, 5 stars ,I have suffered religious wounding at a young age in a hell fire church. So much so that I would not set foot in a Christian church for decades. The approach to Christ by the ministry heals that wounding. Then too there is  the loving care shown by the congregation.,3 years ago
Patrick McMaster, 5 stars ,"I have enjoyed the last 6 years of going to Covenant Presbyterian.  It is an interesting mix of liberal theology and old time religious music and community.  The Choir is only accompanied by a piano, but the arrangements and depth of talent is amazing for such a smaller size church. The Pastors are very connected with the Faith community at Covenant as you would expect with a small congregation.  All of our family has been welcomed and loved by a wonderful congregation.",9 years ago
