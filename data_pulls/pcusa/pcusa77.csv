Anthony Ghost, 5 stars ,Beautiful Church and even more Beautiful people !! The atmosphere is just Amazing and fun and inviting! The church is really old and has that Olde Southern charm it's like someone reached into a fairy tale and pulled out the town church ... I would recommend stopping by if you're ever in the neighborhood on sunday from 10:50am to 11:00am and I think you'll be quite surprised,3 years ago
