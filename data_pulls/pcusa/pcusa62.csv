Charles Holden, 5 stars ,This is the most open and friendliest church I have ever walked into. We just moved here from Northern Virginia and we were looking for a new place to attend church. From the moment we walked in we were greeted by friendly members of the congregation. If you are looking you must come by and see it for yourselves. Pastor John is very driven to interpret the word of Jesus to the modern world.,4 years ago
