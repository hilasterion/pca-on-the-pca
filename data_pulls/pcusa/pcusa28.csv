Dick Hodgetts, 5 stars ,"Historic church in Madison with relatively young Pastor. Has strong youth programs & pre-school  program.  Pastor David Powers has made significant strides in his pulpit presence in this his first Sr. Pastor role. Church is alive with all kinds of programs for those seeking a Church home. Congregants include talented men & women from all walks of Madison's community life. A good place to find your spiritual life, with a Pastor wise beyond his years.

Not sure I should be evaluating a Church that serves so many so well.........",5 years ago
