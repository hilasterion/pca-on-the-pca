Palatine Parcels LLC, 3 stars ,"Ironically my car couldn't make it to the circle K down the street and I had to stop here! While I did not attend a service here, the angels from Sunday's service must have been on my side. I had a serious car break down and by the grace of GOD a stranger (angel) came by and was able to help me enough so that I could drive myself home. I must say the church looked beautiful on the outside and there was ample parking space to attend a service. Thank you Jesus that they didn't have they're parking lot roped off and I was able to park here briefly!!!",a year ago
