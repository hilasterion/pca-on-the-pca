Joseph H. Vilas, 3 stars ,"Am I seriously being asked to review a place of worship?  I don't exactly feel qualified for that.  But any time that I've been there, it seems like a nice welcoming place.  I've even voted there once.  And I believe there's an associated preschool, day care, or something like that.  But it's basically a Presbyterian church near downtown Durham (NC).",2 weeks ago
Kelsey Nelson, 5 stars ,"This is a wedding review - I knew that I wanted to be married in a church, and I spent weeks trying to find one that didn't have ridiculous restrictions and rules. It was a very disappointing process. My own church was meeting in a high school, so that wasn't really an option. For most churches, if they don't have the rule that you have to be a member, they have rules about using their pastors, no photography at all, music restrictions, program restrictions, ridiculous pricing, etc. FINALLY, I found First Presbyterian Church in Durham, NC. This building is absolutely amazing - one of the most beautiful interiors I have ever seen. To make things more awesome, it didn't cost a ridiculous amount of money, and Alissa Miles is their designated wedding coordinator. She loves her job and is AMAZING at it. They did give me a somewhat intimidating rulebook at first, but once I actually talked with Alissa, I realized that they were extremely laid back and really wanted my day to be what I had envisioned. None of their rules got in my way at all. Alissa was there for the rehearsal, and she was there to direct everyone on the day of. There is also a sound coordinator, and he was on top of every detail - microphones, the mp3 for the recessional (which was a secular song - most churches wouldn't have allowed it), and anything else sound-related. I LOVED LOVED LOVED being married in this church. I recommend it to anyone looking for a ceremony venue in the Triangle. So wonderful!!",8 years ago
Walt Barron, 5 stars ,"Full disclosure - I've been a member at First Pres for many years. At first glance, there are many things to like about it - its history, its downtown location, the interesting and thought-provoking programs, the gorgeous sanctuary (with sound so good it doubles as a music venue) and more. But the real beauty of this church is that everyone is welcome there - and I mean everyone. The only requirement (as I've experienced) is that you be open-minded and welcoming to others as well. It's definitely worth a look.",6 years ago
Carlo Diy, 5 stars ,"I first started coming to First Pres in 2012 and joined in 2013.  It has been a wonderful faith home.  I love how involved and invested the First Pres family is in the future of downtown Durham.  The church is passionate about social justice and standing with those on the margins.  I'm a member of the young adults group which does a weekly Sunday school, monthly potlucks, and other fellowship and volunteer activities.  All great people!  And great companions as we learn, grow, and live in Christ.",8 years ago
Elder C Charles, 5 stars ,"First time visiting this particular church due to  the location of a NAACP meeting. The church was celebrating 160 years of existence. The original drawings and current ones were on display in the vestibule. The designs and features over this period were amazing. I loved the wood mouldings and gold chandeliers. Due to our first meeting at this particular church, we were able to meet with the assistant pastor of First Presbyterian, new and former members of the NAACP including former mayor pro tem, Ms. Cora McFadden, and addressing the concerns of voting changes, affordable housing, education, and healthcare. Beautiful church/landmark and would visit again.",3 years ago
Carl Anglin, 5 stars ,"Beautiful church with wonderful people. Big but still very friendly and welcoming to everyone. Their age-related groups are active and add to the experience, but new people have to want to participate to make the most of this fellowship.",4 years ago
Christyn Klinck, 5 stars ,"Landed in Durham in 1988 with my new spouse in our mid-20s and visited several churches. FPC warmly welcomed us from the very first day. Decades of the ups and downs of life later we still love this church, which has supported us in so many ways. And on Sundays: great music, great sermons, and great food at monthly lunches after worship. We have been challenged in our faith and in how we live out our daily lives. Our four kids have made life-long friendships--with their peers and with adults in the church. We hope we can be as welcoming to visitors and new members as those folks in 1988 were to us.",6 years ago
Dawn Carsey, 5 stars ,"What my family found here almost ten years ago holds true for today:  this is a congregation who is comfortable asking hard questions, who believes in God, and they continually ask themselves what it means for the church to follow Jesus.  The people here are honest about who they are -- it is ok to be transparent here about your shortcomings.  Bonus:  this is not a ""dry clean only"" crowd.  Feel free to dress comfortably.",6 years ago
Rebecca Harvard, 5 stars ,"First Presbyterian Church is downtown by history and by choice.  The congregation has a long standing tradition of outreach to the most marginalized in our society and around the world and if you care about these things, and want to be a part of a welcoming, loving community, FPC is for you.  First Presbyterian Church is a graciously hospitable place--welcoming ALL people--that also has an incredible staff, beautiful sanctuary, inspirational ministry of music and many other thriving ministries.",8 years ago
