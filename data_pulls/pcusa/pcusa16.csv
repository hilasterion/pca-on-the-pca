Columbia Squirrel, 5 stars ,"After experiencing a lot of church trauma with previous churches, I had to regain my faith and learn what a healthy view of God and the Bible is, and Lucas and Dawn welcomed me with open arms and are a great example of what servants of the Lord are. They truly listen to you, love you, and speak Godâ€™s word that reflects his character, prioritizing loving all people as God would.",a year ago
