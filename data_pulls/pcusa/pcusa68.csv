Charles Williams, 5 stars ,"Great service! Pastor is loving and caring of the members of not only the church but in the community. Members are actively involved in community service, exampled by collection of money to support homeless veterans, fund raisers like choral performance for Black Mountain Childrens Home.  If you are looking for a church of friendly people, active in the community, visit Franklin First Presbyterian Church. Tell them Chuck sent you.",3 years ago
