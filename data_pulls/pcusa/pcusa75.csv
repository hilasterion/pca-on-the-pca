Brian Fox, 5 stars ,"Wonderful church, services are bright and welcoming. The pipe organ and stained glass work are amazing and they do additional community programs beyond the regular worship schedules.",9 months ago
Paul Austin, 5 stars ,I think rex is wrong zbout Mary being pushy. I think you have statements on 2 levels. Jesus wont do a miracle the Sad. and Phar. can use to hasten His life but He will do miracle in Cana--away from Jerusalem for His mother's friends. Hes not obeying/disobeying His mother but preparing those who understand what His life will be like. Paul Austin,10 months ago
Heather Mueller, 5 stars ,"Saw christmas service here for 4 years. A short and sweet holiday service that includes my favorite part of the service...singing silent night and lighting candles! Current minister is from Bethesda Maryland too, which is close to where I grew up! He's a great guy, and gives great sermons.",2 years ago
