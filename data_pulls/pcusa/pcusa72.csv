Allen Harper, 5 stars ,"AMAZING  VPK program. Art, Chapel time, Music,“Monkeynastics” My wife went to preschool here so she wanted to enroll our daughter here. I will now send my son here in four years. The principle stands out front every morning greats each child and has a special and individual relationship with each one. They know every child’s first and last name exactly what room they are in. Knows all the parents names. I knew that when I left my daughter here she was going to be safe and receive the utmost care, attention, and education.  Also great church service",3 years ago
Allison Hardin, 5 stars ,If you live in Jacksonville and looking for a church that is friendly and welcomed everyone with open arms this is definitely the place to go. Everyone who attends church are the sweetest and the pastor Dr Dave is the best and goes above and beyond to be there for your family through a major life changing crisis. I'm not a church person usually but everytime I am in jax I always attend church with our grandma. They also do so many events to bring everyone together and have fun. Sunday morning 10 am service is the best time than at 11 you go to fellowship hall for coffee and snacks.,3 years ago
