Rollin Van Broekhoven, 5 stars ,"With over 100 years’ relationship to this church (my grandfather was founding pastor I’m 1912), living in the Washington, DC area I have come to think of it as a home church during the covid-19 and would not miss a service online!  Pastor Mike Hoyt is wonderful and this far away, has become a friend, faithful teacher, and pastor!",2 years ago
