Barbara, 5 stars ,"For the last 40 years Iâ€™ve felt like White Memorial was home.,",a month ago
Timothy Shelley, 5 stars ,"We do not go to church here but my children go to the weekday school.  Above all we love the feeling of community this school has.  The Director is an absolute Saint all familiar with her will agree with me.  The teaching staff is top notch, we have fell in love with our kids teachers each year.  The Christmas and Valentines dances for the families are wonderful.  All ages are on floor dancing and smiling.  The feeling of love is all around you when you are there, even if your there for just 5 minutes dropping off your child.  This church even though I am not a religious person has left a life lasting impression on me.  I am a better person for knowing people that work and go to church there.",3 years ago
