Courtney Fowler, 5 stars ,"One of my hobbies is church hopping, meaning I go to different churches by myself to see which ones are nice and learn different things from different perspectives. This church is the one that I go to regularly now. The people are genuine and frendly. No judgement or condescending looks or comments. They keep it nice and simple. Nobody bothers you if you don't want to be bothered. They have earned my respect.",4 years ago
