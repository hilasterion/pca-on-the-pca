Lina Bina, 1 star ,"Never heard of a church turning away a abused pregnant mother..
These people did..
All she was asking was if anyone in the church was looking to part ways with baby items..
The lady who answered the phone cut her off mid sentence and said no we dont have anyone to help you..
Screw you people
My friend was rapped and has nothing and you just quickly rush her off the phone..
Screw u is the nice way",6 years ago
