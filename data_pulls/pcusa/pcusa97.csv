mattg629, 5 stars ,"Moved to Statesboro from Athens in 2012.  This church went out of its way to welcome us in as family.  What we love so much about this church is they focus on being relational, diverse, collaborative, hopeful, and agile. They provide us with a hopeful space for robust conversations about theology and present day culture. They possess strong, faithful leadership in a time of adaptive change, and encourage collaboration and creativity in meeting the needs of the people of Statesboro and across the Coastal Empire.  This, in turn, helps us follow Christ in this modern world.   Also, their work in the community is continual and growing.",5 years ago
