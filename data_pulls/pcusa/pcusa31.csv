Anne Barron, 5 stars ,"It took a while when I first moved to Atlanta to find a church where I really felt welcome and included, not like an outsider. People were friendly and kind at North Avenue. That was 12 years ago. Now I’m one of the congregation and I can say we truly practice Radical Hospitality, one of our collective core values. All are welcome any time. . . Let loving kindness abound!!",4 years ago
nancy hamalian, 5 stars ,This has been a wonderful community to live out our faith over the last 10 years.  We appreciate the diversity of people from all walks of life. Our children were shaped into followers of Jesus through the children and youth programs. We have been able to serve in various capacities.,4 years ago
Tom McLeod, 5 stars ,"A great place to worship.  Wonderful music. Biblical teaching is solid. Several graduates from theological seminaries and numerous students, faculty, and staff from Georgia Tech are members here. Many members were born outside the U.S., but all services are in English. Two levels of parking  are available. Drive in from Peachtree or Courtland. There are building entrances from each level. One block from North Avenue ATL rail station. Dress in layers. Air conditioning is variable and unpredictable.",3 years ago
Dana Klest, 5 stars ,"The Members of NAPC come from all walks of life with widely varied social, economic, political, and national backgrounds. Many families have members from 4 generations while others feel at home just walking through the door. Many of us see life differently from each other, but instead of leaving because we differ, we value each other enough to do the hard work of staying in community together and learning from our differences. We are family and we genuinely care for each other.",4 years ago
Debbie Malek, 5 stars ,"Beautiful stain glass windows, I recently attended a funeral at this church and it so lovely to see the sun shine through, it made the service heavenly.",a year ago
Jane Going, 5 stars ,"North Avenue offers an authentic and exceptional worship experience. Today’s service was a beautiful message which offered the same hope given years ago in the book of Isaiah.  Pastor Scott made it relevant to our world today, weaving the message given to that community long ago in their difficult and conflicted times. It was an appropriate message for the church today - as we experience challenging and sometimes seemly hopeless events. The NAPC positive message ALWAYS shares HOPE. We always leave with a relevant message which helps us navigate through this complex world.
Our music additionally is outstanding as well as current. If you are thinking ‘all churches are alike’ you’ve not given North Avenue a visit!
Give us a try: our hospitality will influence your return!",4 years ago

Judy Billings, 5 stars ,"I actively looked for a church for two years—for a place people would see me, where I could really engage and not just sit alone in a chair or a pew. I found North Avenue and it’s ministries 10 years ago, and it has been home ever since.",3 years ago
Kim Goldsmith, 5 stars ,"This congregation is my extended family. They pray for me, encourage me, challenge me, and love me. They are warm and inviting, and my children think of North Ave as their home.",4 years ago
Laura Gettler, 5 stars ,"Small Great Things, a novel by Jodi Picoult, is the story of an experienced African-American nurse, Ruth, who is forbidden to provide care for an infant whose white supremacist father demands she have no contact with his child. When the baby dies,  Ruth is held responsible and tried for murder. The story is told through the voices of the nurse, the father, and Ruth's white female public defender. June 13 at about 7:15 pm Women's Ministry will hold a discussion of the impact of racism and prejudice and what we have learned from this reading. Enter from Peachtree Street, park, and come into the well lit atrium.",4 years ago
