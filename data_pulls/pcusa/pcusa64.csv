Gail Jarvis, 5 stars ,"Inspiring Pastor and congregation: a feeling of real, religious, caring people surrounds you right away.  The musical director is outstanding and presents unusual musical interludes that are very moving.  A community-focused church that puts words into action with both Manna and a food-donation program in full force.",3 years ago
