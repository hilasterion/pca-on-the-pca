Christy Smith, 5 stars ,"This church hosts the local symphony. Everyear they have the Starlight symphony in the front lawn. Hundreds of people and children set up chairs, tables, and blankets for a wonderful evening... The church bells chime... The band plays...The parking lot hosts cannons that are shot during the last song.... Shout-out to the church for such a lovely, free family community event.",2 months ago
