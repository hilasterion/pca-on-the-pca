April Ross, 5 stars ,"Generous and welcoming to ""all-neighbors."" Incredible and inclusive community support!  Two weeks ago, I participated with Skycrest Elementary teachers and principals, volunteers and neighborhood families in their recent #farmsharepinellascounty event. From farm-fresh bananas, and crispy arugula greens all the way to gallon jugs of water and even baby diapers (newborns to potty-training sizes) ... I fell in love with these guys! I belong to a church nearby. Just so happy to meet more church families in my neighborhood with such giving  hands and hearts.",5 years ago
