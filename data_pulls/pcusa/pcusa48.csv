Ultreya, 5 stars ,"This is the kind of church an atheist truly appreciates. They actually practice the teachings of Christ in all the best ways possible. Love, charity, & kindness and good deeds all the time. Plus they have a stellar group of artists in residence. If you're looking for a place to practice kindness for all living creatures, this is your church, even for an atheist.",3 years ago

Orda Powell, 5 stars ,"What a great force in the community Central is becoming, with their new and creative hosting, attracting so many artist-tenants, and not-for-profit community organizations & Azalea City Montessori school, in addition to regular church services and programs. Hopefully new income will bring enough to help put some reno love into this wonderful old facility and attract new Sunday regulars.",3 years ago

Marie Lange, 5 stars ,"This Church offers its space regularly to many types of organizations. They have a free breakfast, very filling, the first Saturday of every month at 7 a.m. I believe it is. (I've not managed to get up on Saturday that early in a long while now.) It is a free breakfast but I would always donate $5 at least. There is always a slight sermon and prayer holding hands together. And a good speaker, sometimes from all over the world. A warm friendly place to be. I do not know if the same minister is still there.",a year ago
