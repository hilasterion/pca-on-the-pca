An Cosm, 5 stars ,"Very friendly place. Walked in on a Saturday morning as a a stranger off of the street. I had gotten a free ticket for their pancake breakfast, which was awesome by the way. Everyone was polite and cheerful and willing to talk. In fact, I met a new friend, Rob, who actually sat down with me and we talked thru breakfast about Korea and Korean food and he gave me great tips on local Korean shops and restaurants in Fayetteville. What a guy ! I need to text him and say Merry Christmas. Thanks again Highland for the wonderful experience and delicious food. Will definitely go back if I have the chance.",2 years ago
