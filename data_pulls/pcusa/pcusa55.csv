debbie randolph, 5 stars ,"I got invited to see a friend of mine in a local theater production of ""Twelve Angry Men"" and we had dinner before and we had about 120 of us attend this production and South Jacksonville Presbyterian Church was very gracious to allow us to park there and the theatre was within walking distance, and we got to park there. The theatre was located in a busy area (San Marco Square) with shops and restaurants (very busy on a Saturday night) so parking space wasn't the best, so we were fortunate to have a place to park. The performance was sold out that night and the production was awesome!",3 years ago
