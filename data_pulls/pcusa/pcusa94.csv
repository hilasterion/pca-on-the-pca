Glenn Morley, 5 stars ,"I have a lifelong love for the First Presbyterian Church. As a child, Sunday school at First Pres. was a safe, fun, even magical place. Songs and stories learned will be with me always. From childhood through high school we attended Wednesday night supper, Sunday service, many many weddings, baptisms, and funerals- all celebrating life. Thank you First Presbyterian(and my family!) for providing a place of learning values, trust, kindness, forgiveness, joy , and even humor.",11 months ago
