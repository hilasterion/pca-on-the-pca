Rex Goss, 5 stars ,"Rev Bailey, supports the murder of unborn children in the womb, she supports the choice of that. She is not a true woman of God, but supports killing the life He places in the womb. its an outrage. I have to rate this Church down.  In response to the Churches response to my review below. Trolling accusation is a distraction. The situation is what is important. Apparently you think being friendly is more important than obeying the ten commandments.  I learned about you from a report, you have gained national attention. I did not go looking for you. You are not a Church of God, because your minister supports the murdering of the children that God obviously places in the womb. He is the creator of life. Your Church is supporting the destruction of His creation. This is plain as day. Fake Churches must be called out where they are, my locale matters not. People need to be protected from false Christians and false Churches. Your evil destruction of life (by supporting such) must be called out everywhere. You want to welcome me while you wont even stand up and welcome God's little babies into the world. That is sick and twisted.",2 years ago

Mary Yarbrough, 5 stars ,This place refused to help a family in need the I guess it was the secretary refused to let us speak with a pastor Everytime my family has called this church it's been major problems they call them selves Christians yet they don't truly act like it this is why my family has a hard time finding churches as a home,a year ago
Wanda Mack, 5 stars ,"We are happy to help our neighbors with food, hygiene kits and clothes every Sunday. On Monday and Wednesday mornings we offer space for folks to meet with caseworkers and sign up for food stamps. Twice a month we help folks get birth certificates and state IDs. We are a small congregation, and sadly can't help with every need. Best of luck to you and your family.",2 years ago
