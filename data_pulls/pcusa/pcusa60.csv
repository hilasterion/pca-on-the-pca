sharon libnoch, 5 stars ,"This is a wonderful church and congregation! It is truly a welcoming community. Pastor Allen gives such heartfelt sermons and has so much support from Pastor Edna and Katie Adams not to mention Pastor's wife Mary and her work with the young and young at heart. There are so many more people working in great rolls that make this such a special place to worship and be involved with. The music director, Chuck is passionate with his piano playing and working with the choir. It is always a joy to be at the service. The members are involved in many projects and events for example they hold an Easter egg hunt for the children, there is a blessing of the pets, and there are two Cantatas; one for Easter and one for Christmas. Also, if you have a well behaved dog they are welcome to come and worship with you!! They also hold sessions called ""Lunch and Learn, and Pub Theology"". It is definitely worth a Sunday morning visit.",3 years ago
