Melody Faust, 4 stars ,"This church is amazing. I have been here for awhile but I am still amazed. We lack in youth so therefore a very small youth group. However, we are equipped to have one that would be even better if we had more youth. The congregation is warm and accepting to all that enter which is what I feel a church should be.",11 months ago
