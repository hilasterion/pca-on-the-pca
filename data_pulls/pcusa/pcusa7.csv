Trey Dean, 5 stars ,I go here for boy scouts. It has a really nice campus with a lot of room for games and a playground for the younger ones to play on. I personally have never been to a worship service there but I know the pastor because he used to serve at our church.,2 years ago
Jeff Fuller, 5 stars ,I have been a member for twenty plus years and have watched my children grow up in the church.  Such a loving family of people who believe in the power of prayer.  You would not believe the miracles of prayer that I have witnessed over the years.  You must come and check out what's happening at Carmel.  Are you all in?,8 years ago
