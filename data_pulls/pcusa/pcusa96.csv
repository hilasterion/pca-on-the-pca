Talon Hall, 5 stars ,I go to church here so itâ€™s pretty cool,a week ago
Christina Shaver, 5 stars ,"My only criticisms are that children's church only goes through kindergarten and Wednesday night activities start too early for a working single parent of 3, with 2 in day care, to attend. Really like the vision, ministries, missionaries and sermons offered and supported by the church. I have been visiting since September 2018.",3 years ago
