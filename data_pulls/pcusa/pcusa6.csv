Ben Hardman, 1 star ,BE WARNED!!!! The grace Presbyterian preschool needs prayers. They turned their back on my son who has special needs. The place we thought would help us most turned their backs on us! Our son went there last year and we were informed that he would need to be fully potty trained to go back for the three year old classroom. He is autistic and nonverbal. He is not understanding the whole potty training idea yet. I emailed the teacher to ask if there was something we could work out. Even suggesting I could go up there and change him myself during the day so he could stay in a classroom setting with his friends he made last year. The teacher emailed me back saying it was a board decision and asked the director. The teacher emailed me back and said sorry it was a no. They discriminated against his disability! This is shameful behavior from a church.,7 years ago
Jason Davenport, 5 stars ,"Great people, a worship team that regularly decorates and updates for meaningful worship experiences, great children's programs, caring people with a deep and meaningful understanding of what it means to ""love one another."" While no church is perfect (because they are all made up of people) this one is pretty close.",4 years ago
