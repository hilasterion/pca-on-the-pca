Matt Nielson, 5 stars ,"As the son of preachers and having been to many diff denominations over the years, upon moving to Oxford, we made several visits to First Pres and connected with the mission, the pastors, and the people of this place. They are welcoming to everyone, kind, and thoughtful. We love being part of this congregation.",2 years ago
Will Westmoreland, 5 stars ,"Gone here all my conscious life. Beautiful stain glass windows that invites the sun inside to startling, almost mystical effect. Great pastor, great congregation, an overwhelmingly peaceful and spiritual place. If you're ever in Oxford stop by, Presbyterian, Christian or otherwise. You will not regret it.",3 years ago
