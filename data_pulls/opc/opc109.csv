Christina Mancini, 5 stars ,"This lovely family of believers is our second church home where we worship when we visit the Lakes Region. Pastor Andy preaches the gospel boldly and accurately, and there is much love among the brothers and sisters.

To the extent that the Westminster Confession of Faith is firmly rooted in the scripture, Grace affirms the Confession, as do all Reformed Presby churches.  That said, preaching at Grace is expository, opening entire books of the Old and New testament, passage by passage, to worshippers. The Confession is never given equal authority with the inspired, inerrant word of God in the Scriptures. To suggest otherwise is patently incorrect.

If we ever move up here from CT, Grace PCA will be our church home.",4 years ago
JR Woods, 2 stars ,"They love Scripture. That's for sure. However, most of the time they quote from confessions as though they were on par with Scripture. And they rope you into ""vows"" for membership that do nothing more than require you to devote your paycheck to them. They make big claims about ""helping the body of Christ"" but consistently refuse to help real people in their midst with issues. They put all their confidence in medical doctors that kill their members time and time again but still ask God to heal their sick, even though they've been offered the best health care from National Institutes of Health program manager Dr. Joel Wallach, they refused because it might embarrass the all-important medical doctor who worships there and devotes his large paycheck. All they want is money. All whom they'll work with are people who give it to them.",4 years ago
