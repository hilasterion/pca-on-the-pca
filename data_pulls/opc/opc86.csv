Andrea Bauer, 5 stars ,"Have attended this church since 1965 and have always felt welcomed and not just a member of the congregation but of the family of God.  Everyone cares about and for each other, rejoicing in times of  joy and  there to lend an ear and support in times of need and sorrow.  Sound Biblical teaching by a minister whose joy and love of God is exuded in all of his services.",4 years ago

This is a place where brothers and sisters in Christ gather together to worship the Lord, pray for one another, and care for each other's needs.",4 years ago
