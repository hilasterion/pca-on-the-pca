Steve Harvey, 5 stars ,"We thoroughly enjoyed the service at this church Sunday! While we were at the church, several of the members and the pastor of the church came up to greet us and make us feel welcome. This is a small, but comfortable and conservative Church. The pastor's sermon was interesting and informative concerning Biblical principles. There are a lot of children in the congregation and during the service they behaved extremely well!",a year ago
