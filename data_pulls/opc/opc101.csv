Jeffrey Crawford, 5 stars ,"This is a small, humble, faithful church who s pastors are faithful to teach the Holy and Perfect Word of God regularly by grace and not by works. It is by grace alone, by faith alone, in Christ alone by which we are saved and continue to be sanctified. The congregation as I know them by and large does it’s best ‘good faith effort’ to obey and walk daily with the Lord. But they, I believe in large, would take no credit in this regard, and be the first to admit their great need for Christ and of His daily forgiveness and need for continued work of grace in their lives - attempting to live by the principle of continual repentance and faith. They will teach that if we repentantly confess our sins, Christ remembers them no more and separates them from us ‘as far as the east is from the west.’ These sins have been forgiven by the perfect atonement of Christ s death, and resurrection. By the humble acknowledgement of my sin and pride and the magnificent act of atonement by Christ’s work, just that simply, our lives and eternity are secure in Christ. Yet, we tend to make it so hard for ourselves. Life delivers very hard things and I don’t mean to be unempathetic to what some may be going through, but I know by faith the Heavenly Father is not indifferent to our suffering. The entirety of Scripture supports that He cares and comforts. I have come to understand, as is the strong nature of man, that we always want to make spiritual faith about working or earning our way to heaven. It is in our DNA to want to default to this type of thinking. They will teach you because of this bent, ‘for every one view of our sin, we need to look at Christs forgiveness and redemption a thousand times.’

And, while this church and attendance there is not what I see as the simple basis for what I have witnessed and am about to say, but thru the regular encouragement in faithfully teaching the Word of God in the Biblical principles of reformed theology, observationally, I have seen a great many second and third and some even fourth generations of families here where the children and the children of children are faithfully walking with Christ and holding fast to Him. While not finding fault in others, I believe something in this regard is lost in today’s culture in many churches. I believe one of, if not the most important vital signs of spiritual health, is a desire to be in Gods Word daily and have a tremendous desire for it and to worship with His church regularly. My desire in these regards has grown considerably in the 7-8 years I have been attending here.

May the Lord lead you to worship where you will be drawn close to Him and learn that He loves you ‘more than all the treasures of the earth.’",3 years ago
