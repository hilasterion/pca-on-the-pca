Chuck Noren, 5 stars ,"Excellent church. Attended Sunday school and the morning service on Resurrection Sunday, otherwise known as Easter. I liked the selection of hymns. The order of worship is the classic, rich, traditional Protestant Reformed service. The preaching was excellent, in the Reformed tradition. It was easy to follow, meaty, Christ centered, uplifting.

Parking is across the street. The people are very friendly. There is Sunday school for all ages. I wore a sport coat, without tie, and fit right in. I'm sure you can come as you are.

Providence is in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC) denomination, a theologically conservative denomination that has its roots in the Swiss Reformation of John Calvin and the Scottish Reformation.",a year ago
Jennifer L, 5 stars ,"We really enjoyed our visit to Providence OPC. The service was wonderful, with a great sermon. We were especially encouraged by the friendly welcome we received. We look forward to visiting again when we're back in Mifflinburg!

(If you're planning to visit, leave a couple of extra minutes to figure out parking. I always forget that Mifflinburg has all those one-way streets, haha.)",11 months ago
