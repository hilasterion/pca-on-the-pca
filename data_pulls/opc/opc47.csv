Cedar Church, 5 stars ,"I personally know Pastor Ryan Cavanaugh and the good folks of Mission Church. What a spirited, warm and loving group of believers. They love Jesus and they love people! I wish Ryan were my pastor, but I serve as a pastor two hours away, so my loss is Merrillvilleâ€™s gain! I highly recommend this church.     - Pastor Steve",4 years ago
Nathan Luzwick, 5 stars ,"In-depth biblical exposition, a knowledgeable pastor passionate about truth, and a warm and welcoming congregation make for a gem of a church. My family and I travel over an hour to worship here and it is well worth the drive.",3 years ago
