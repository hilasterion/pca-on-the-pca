From His Fullness Ministries, 5 stars ,"My wife and I have been members of Little Farms Chapel for the past year, and have truly been blessed by the faithful and passionate ministry of the Word and the commitment of the pastor, Bob VanManen. The congregation is overseen by committed elders, and deacons possessing integrity with the finances and vision for missions. The congregation is a marvelous balance of ages,  with a balanced worship style, and is growing numerically and, more importantly, spiritually. Under God, a strong foundation has been laid for further developments (local outreach comes to mind). If, then, you have valid reason for looking for a church , and are looking for one which seeks to prioritize God and his Word in a Reformed but relevant way (highly recommended!),  the ministry of Little Farms Chapel awaits you.",4 years ago
