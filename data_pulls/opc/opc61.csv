Brian Withnell, 5 stars ,"The best thing about this church is they really worship God. When people do worship the God of the Bible, they tend to not only grow spiritually, but they grow in love to one another. Pastor Hammond (Chip) is probably the best pastor I have ever seen. I've seen really good pastors ... but he is so caring. Seems all the people there care for each other. It isn't a church where you don't do anything ... but then, what's the point if everything is done for you? Why attend a church at all? They want people to get involved. Got to be one of the best church ever.",3 years ago
Mike B, 5 stars ,"Bethel is a church that is passionate about following Jesus Christ. I've found the Sunday sermons by Pastor George C. Hammond (Chip) to be quite deep and engaging.  Bethel offers Sunday School at 9:45 and Worship at 11am, and has numerous areas to get involved including small groups that meet twice per month, and numerous ministries.  Certainly worth a visit.",4 years ago
