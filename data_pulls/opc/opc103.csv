Bill MacDonald, 5 stars ,"Pilgrim Church is a friendly, Bible-preaching, Bible-living congregation. The worship services follow a pattern of singing, prayer, preaching, and service to God that follows the Scriptures in an inspiring way; it's more liturgical than many modern churches, yet it's not stiffly formal. The people are quick to welcome visitors, and they clearly love one another through acts of kindness and mercy. I would recommend Pilgrim to anyone looking for a church home, especially if they want to hear God's grace and mercy preached and taught.",a year ago
