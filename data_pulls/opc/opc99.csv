John Hitchner, 5 stars ,"Pastor Claude is one of the best.  The congregation is filled with sincerity and diversity. If you want a place to comfortably study the word of God,  I highly recommend this church. It's not a mega church,  there aren't flashy lights; but if you want to learn you should come visit. All are welcome.",5 years ago
