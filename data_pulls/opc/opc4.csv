David Eardley, 5 stars ,"Here you will receive a thorough and conservative exposition of the word of God.
The congregation is welcoming and you will find a very nice balance between older members and families with young children. The church has been well shepherded for the last 4 decades by a fine man of God Reverend Mark Brown and a new man now fills the pulpit Reverend Chad Mullinix. He delivers a thoroughly doctrinal yet easily applicable message.  Having said that I do not know which is better - his superb sermons  or his heartfelt prayers!",2 years ago
