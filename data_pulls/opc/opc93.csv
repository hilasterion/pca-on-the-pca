Jennifer Byrd, 5 stars ,"Wonderful church that our family has been attending for eight years now. Medium-sized congregation, lots of kids and teens, and homey, loving, welcoming atmosphere. Traditional hymns and solid, Bible-based preaching. Highly recommend a visit if you're in the area !",3 years ago
