Matt Bradshaw, 5 stars ,"The people there are very friendly. The sermons are relatable and thought provoking. A nursery is available for children, allowing parents the ability to attend services. There is usually a carry-in meal after service unless there's a holiday. I can't recommend the Church enough.",3 years ago
Dirk Ippel, 5 stars ,"Great Church,  Great Preaching!",5 years ago
