Matilda Watson, 5 stars ,New Hope has been my home church for nearly 17 years. It is a wonderful place where the Gospel of Christ is clearly and boldy preached. The community is also very welcoming and there are lots of opportunities for fellowship and discipleship. So thankful for my Church and for Pastor Francis!,3 years ago
Elease Layman, 5 stars ,"When we came to New Hope four years ago, we felt so welcome! Pastor Francis and his family even had us over for lunch our first Sunday here. His preaching is consistently gospel-focused, thoughtful, well-studied, energetic, and even entertaining (yes, we in the OP can chuckle every now and then!). The worship time is organized in a meaningful way without feeling too stiff/liturgical. Sunday morning dress can vary from casual to coat-and-tie, often depending on your generation. And pretty much all generations are represented here! From newborn to 95 years old, New Hope runs the gamut. You'll also find families who homeschool, private school, and public school. It really is a welcoming community.

Outside of Sunday worship, there's a steadily growing men's ministry breakfast (I hear the bacon is delicious) on the first Saturdays and a ladies' night out (organized by yours truly) on the third Thursdays of every month. There's a biweekly Wednesday night Bible study and frequent potluck whole-church meals. Stop in some time!",5 years ago
Kyle Graf, 5 stars ,"New Hope OPC has been my church home for the past 3 years.  My wife and I became members shortly after we got married.  We were looking for a church body that was faithful to Scripture, focused on the Gospel, and had a strong community that cared for each other and the world.  All of this was found at New Hope.  I would encourage anyone looking for a church home to come visit New Hope.",5 years ago
