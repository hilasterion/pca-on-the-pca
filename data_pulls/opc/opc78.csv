K M, 5 stars ,"Pastor Ken Golden is very personable and made sure he chatted with me. He suggested we meet for coffee to discuss any questions I had. We will meet today, in fact! The service seems biblical from what I saw online and I will attend an in- person service today. I look forward to meeting with Pastor Golden to discuss this Churches beliefs along with the books he provided!",2 years ago
