Free Resources, 1 star ,"You are struggling with mistreatment from those you trusted, and your close friend dies. All looks bleak. You reach out to a biblical counseling for help and encouragement, but instead, you get Bible verses twisted out of context, your counselor yelling at you for pointing out the fact that she is twisting verses out of context, and your counselor mocking you for something that you didn't even say! Not to mention, no apologies one she realized that she realized her error. So, regarding fruits: no love, no patience, no gentleness, no self-control. The Bible says Jesus was compassionate, and a bruised reed He will not break, yet here, Maureen Sutton only had apathy. Not to mention, the Bible states that one should not give an answer before listening, and once again, that is what she did. At the end, Maureen gave me a book and invited me to a book club. As if I'm going to drive 40 minutes down to a church when one of its representatives treats me this poorly. She didn't even follow up with me. I could have went home and ended it all, and I'm sure she would not have cared. Really? This is what biblical counseling looks like? If you can't help someone, it's called a referral. You don't mock them due to your inability to help. I bet someone like this would cry that she is being persecuted for her faith, when in actuality, she's being judged for her hypocrisy. Matthew 23 states that hypocrites face a stricter judgment. Thanks for exposing your true colors, Maureen.",5 months ago
Mark Turner, 5 stars ,"Solid preaching, some of the best community and fellowship you can have. A ton of people always stay after the service, just to talk and get to know each other. Itâ€™s a really good place to be, and Pastor Tim does everything and more to lead well and speak the true word of God, even when the truth is hard.",2 years ago
