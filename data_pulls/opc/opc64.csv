Abigail Rueger, 5 stars ,"This is a faithful congregation of the church of Jesus Christ!  Worship each Sunday is focused on God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit as revealed in the Bible, God's gracious gift to us.  We hope you will join us to be fed with the bread of life and find hope, joy, love, peace, and forgiveness!",3 years ago
