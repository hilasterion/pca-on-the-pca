Glenn Crothers, 5 stars ,"Many Christian Churches today do not preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. Grace OPC does in fact preach the gospel of Jesus Christ. As such, this church community is NOT among the mainline protestant churches bleeding membership due to their milktoast presentation of God's Word,  rather Grace OPC is growing it's membership.
Jesus Christ is the way, truth and life so if you're seeking God's truth; if you're seeking to be among a welcoming truth loving Christian community than Grace OPC of Fairlawn has a seat for you and your family this coming Lord's Day.",2 years ago
Karen Sketchley, 5 stars ,"We thank you for your kind and thoughtful words of your experience attending Grace OPC.  Grace OPC is now open for public Worship each Lord's Day at 11:00 am.
