Beth Austin, 5 stars ,"If you are looking for 3-point self-help sermons, a snappy praise band, and a coffee shop in the lobby, this is not the church for you. However, if you are interested in meeting with a body of believers who worship the Lord through prayer, Psalm-singing, and Christ-centered preaching, you might want to pop in some Sunday, at either 10 AM or 6 PM. You are sure to receive a warm welcome.",3 years ago
