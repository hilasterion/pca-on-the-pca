Skip Dreibelbis, 4 stars ,"Kind and friendly congregation, Pastor and elders.  Good caring people are members of this small Church.
The Church struggles for identity in figuring out if they are reformed in worship as there is a blend of uninspired hymns (normative principle) and Psalms (Regulative principle) in worship with a ratio of 4 uninspired hymns to 1 Psalm in any given service.  Occasional solo acts or groups perform prior to some services.
Good expository preaching with practical application of Scripture.
Observance of days not commanded in Scripture occurs twice a year with sermons reflecting seasonal observances.",2 years ago
