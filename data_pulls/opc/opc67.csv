Sanaz Amiri, 5 stars ,"We’ve been members of Grace for a while now.

Some strong points that are important to us are:
-gospel in the sermon EVERY single week
-members worship, follow,  and serve Jesus, not the church leaders
-wonderful caring community that embrace you wether you have 7 kids homeschooling , or 2, or you’re single.
-international student ministry linked with George Mason University (staff of RUF)
-missions everywhere (local, states, global)
-Sunday school that goes beyond just basics of bible
-women ministry and youth ministry have been great (We haven’t had a chance to attend any other events for other ages but heard they’re good too)
-clean and wonderful nursery
-staff and volunteers are solid church members- I know it sounds weird but I’ve been to churches where church members aren’t involved and church has to hire people- which says a lot
Just the fact that Grace is gospel focused is enough for us but the other things help make the church perfect for our family",3 years ago
