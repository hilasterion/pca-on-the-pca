Terry Liebert, 5 stars ,"My home church; 5 years attending ; we now have a new Pastor. Pastor Jeremy Brandenburg has a lovely wife and 4 young children.  We have been meeting every Sunday, morning and evening throughout this pandemic with precautions,  and liberty of conscience.
Preaching is expository, totally scriptural.We are a bible believing church with Westminster Confession and catechism to support and explain. The best of traditional hymns and a few of the biblically sound modern hymns. We are blessed with an excellent pianist,  Nathan, along with his wife and new baby girl. Love our church!!",a year ago
