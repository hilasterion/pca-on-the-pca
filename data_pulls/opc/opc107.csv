Mary Fieler, 5 stars ,"I’ve attended Pilgrim Presbyterian Church for over 10 years now. While still a fairly new Church, it embodies the Holy Spirt in sinful people who know they will never be perfect, yet by the grace of God they press on to live in love to one another and the community. It’s focus is teaching the Bible, feeding people spiritually and glorifying God in the process as we live out our faith in the world around us. While the world we live in seems increasingly conflicted, angry and hostile as people turn to personal and political advocacy instead of recognizing our creator and sustainer God. We live in the peace and hopefulness of Jesus Christ as we pass through to eternal life.",3 years ago
