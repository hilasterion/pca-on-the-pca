William J Stevens V, 5 stars ,"A really strong, reformed church that has all the elements of loving and welcoming evangelism while remaining true to Scripture. Such a pleasure to worship with families in a liturgical setting that doesn't feel stuffy or rigid; definitely a lively and Spirit-filled spot! Lots of young families and kids along with an involved young-adult community.",2 months ago
