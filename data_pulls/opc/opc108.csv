Jenny M, 5 stars ,"Truly edifying worship with fellow saints who are genuine and encouraging brothers and sisters in Christ. The teaching always takes the Bible seriously, not just individual verses out of context.",a month ago
stevenancy Nadeau, 5 stars ,"We were members at this church for fifteen years until we moved out of state. You will find faithful preaching of the word of God and consistent administration of the sacraments. The people there are like family even after five yearsbeing gone: friendly, genuine, and serious about helping each other live a godly life. Pastor Migotsky has been laboring faithfully here for over twenty years and is a true Pastor. Highly recommend.",2 years ago
