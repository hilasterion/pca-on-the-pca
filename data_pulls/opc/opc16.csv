14er Colorado, 5 stars ,"Really good Sunday meeting with these people. Very warm and welcoming. Great, classic Church music - well done and supportive of the worship service.
Had an after-Church picnic even though was atypically cold weather for June!
Wonderful time talking with large group of people but did not feel out of place.
I'll definitely come back to this Church",3 years ago
