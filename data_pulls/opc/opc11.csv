Dotted Cypher, 5 stars ,"Small church with a tight knit congregation. Bible preaching church with hymnal singing accompanied by a clarinet. Pastor is a humble, God fearing man with a large heart for his community. The church also features a food drive for the needy. The entire community is encouraged to lend their support. This church will remind you of what is important in your Christian walk and will encourage you to grow in Christ.",2 years ago
