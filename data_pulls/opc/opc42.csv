Gary Butcher, 5 stars ,The pastor is very passionate and knowledgeable! All staff and people from the church have been extremely welcoming and caring during an odd time for churches! They have gone above and beyond to continue to serve those who want to attend in person worship services. We really appreciate  everything Pastors Jonathan and Markus do to make Community Presbyterian a small church with a big outreach!,2 years ago
Nathon Meulenberg, 5 stars ,"I highly recommend visiting this church!  The preaching is true to God's Word and Pastor Cruse is gifted with an eloquence that makes the sermons: interesting, easy to understand, and applicable to one's everyday life.

The church members are extremely friendly and welcoming.  There is a good combination of both young and older members who are regular attendees, which means that visitors will always have someone to talk to.  There is a fellowship meal after the morning service on the second Sunday of every month, and visitors are welcome both to worship and to dine with the congregation.",4 years ago
Elisabeth Schumaker, 5 stars ,"This is such a godly, welcoming, loving, faithful, and grounded church. It was the first church my husband and I visited when we moved to Kalamazoo and we knew almost immediately that it was the church for us. The congregation is incredibly thoughtful and friendly, and Pastor Jonathan delivers theologically sound, compelling, gospel-centered sermons. We are very grateful that God led us to Community Presbyterian Church!",4 years ago

Cedar Church, 5 stars ,"I personally know Pastor Jonathan Cruse and the Community Presbyterian congregation. What a passionate group of committed believers in Christ. I wish Jonathan were my pastor, but I serve as a pastor an hour away, so my loss is Kalamazooâ€™s gain! I highly recommend this church.     - Pastor Steve",4 years ago
