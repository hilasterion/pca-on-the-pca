Andy Gruswitz, 5 stars ,"This is a community that I can easily imagine just about anyone would feel blessed to be a part of. Some of my greatest moments of encouragement as a Christian have come from being a witness to the way the living omnipotent creator of the universe still supernaturally and intimately involves Himself with individual flawed men and women through the most ordinary moments. I've had so few interactions with this church body so far but I've already seen so many evidences of this reality here, and it warms my heart to be reminded once again that the Church (with a capital C) is alive and well on this earth. This is a testimony not to great people but a persistently loving God. If you're flawed, but you know or would like to know about a flawless God, you'l meet Him here.

Your children will too. Here's a picture from this year's VBS. I got to watch all the volunteers put this elaborate set together. They did it all with a desire that it would be used for the sake of the gospel in the lives of these kids.",4 months ago

Tim Paauw, 5 stars ,"Nice church and seemed to be good people. The sermon style during my visits was sort of lecture/dictionary sermons and I enjoy a style that is more story and message relation based. Clearly a number of folks attend regularly, but it isn't a place I was called to return to.",5 years ago
