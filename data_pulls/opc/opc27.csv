Tim S, 5 stars ,"Christ Orthodox is a congregation committed to God's Word and all that it entails. They believe the Bible is God's inerrant and infallible Word, which I suppose may make certain folks uncomfortable, but Pastor Jason won't compromise on God's truth no matter what pitfalls the relativist post-modern culture is trying to led Western Christianity into.

These folks love God, embrace truths as clearly described in the Bible, and they love their fellow man.... qualities desperately needed in the Valley",4 years ago
Brianna B, 2 stars ,It's extremely sad that they have such narrow views about worship here. Their website makes them sound narrow minded and orthodox to the point of being xenophobic. Even the Old Testament advocates clapping and dance as a joyful response to the wonders of God. Isaiah 55:12 among others. Their website also sounds like they use shame to control people's behavior. I hope they'll consider rewriting it.,4 years ago
Wayne Feller, 1 star ,"As I read their site, or look at their Youtube videos, they remind me of the Pharisees of Christ's time. They don't care about love or kindness or hope. Theirs is a message of arrogance and exclusion.",4 years ago
