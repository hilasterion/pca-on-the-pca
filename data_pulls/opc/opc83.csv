Starsephiroth, 1 star ,"They try to indoctrinate your children while enjoying themselves on the boardwalk in order to replace their curiosity, empathy and critical thought with complacency, fear, hatred and mindless servitude during formative years, making it impossible to change it.

They should refocus their efforts away from this towards helping those that do need solid change in their lives (because some people later in life can make use of it) rather than scaring kids with eternal damnation for just being kids.

Evangelical‚Äôs use guilt and fear to control children, if you want to use it on an adult and their ok with that, that‚Äôs on the adult. But don‚Äôt proselytize to other people‚Äôs children.",5 months ago
Nick Hathaway, 5 stars ,"Wow! What a legacy of proclaiming forgiveness for sinners and freedom for captives. They have the best offer on the entire boardwalk: eternal joy-filled life for the bow of a knee. Stop by around 8:30p.m. for free shows: gospel skits, songs, and stories.",a year ago
David Petriel (Destroyer83), 5 stars ,"Stayed here for a weekend, on staff. Loved the fellowship, loved the people, loved the messages, loved the prayer, loved the evangelism, the classes, the whole lot of it! Would definitely encourage one who seeks to learn or refine their evangelism, or just seeks to do good for the Kingdom for a week to volunteer.",a year ago
Art Salvagno, 5 stars ,Not a cult but very nice people who care for all and have a strong belief in our savior Jesus Christ.  Take in some free music on a weekday and Saturday night while walking the Wildwood Boardwalk. Rich & I love the atmosphere and sharing the Gospel through music and were humbled and honored to play this venue for the 4th time.,2 years ago

J L, 3 stars ,Not bad. I went in to pray that my wife leaves me for that mechanic she's seeing on the side. So far my prayers are unanswered. Perhaps one day I'll find the salvation I so desperately seek. I would visit again the next time I visit the beautiful Wildwoods.,3 years ago

Megan Slack, 5 stars ,"The people at Boardwalk Chapel were not wearing masks which was ironic considering their preaching words, ‚Äúlove your neighbor.‚Äù Their arguments when presented with facts were extremely weak and I left feeling angry that there are businesses like this that exist.",5 years ago
