Philip De Groot, 5 stars ,"Coming in as a college student, Bethel has been one of the best parts of my experience. The sermons are always insightful and theologically sound, and the whole congregation is extremely warm and welcoming. If you're a visitor, be sure to ask about the weekly visitor lunch (if nobody there catches you first).",3 years ago
Corgi_Shark 307, 5 stars ,"We have been members at Bethel for about 12 years.  Bethel has a classic, traditional worship style.  Pastor Troxel preaches Christ centered, Bible based sermons and always manages to strike a cord with the congregation.

The church family is exactly that.  There are wonderful people to get to know, and everyone is there for you through thick and thin.

If you are looking for a church, I would suggest you give Bethel a try.",3 years ago
