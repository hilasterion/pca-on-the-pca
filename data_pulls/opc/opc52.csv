The Dark Norseman, 5 stars ,"Went here twice back in 2010, but could not stay, unfortunately. Had an emergency come up and immediately moved.

I will say, the youngish pastor was a very wise man, and very giving of his time for myself, as a potential newcomer. Met with me over coffee, brought me books and literature.

Seemed like a very faithful, conservative community, with serious believers. I will say, this is not a ""hoopin and a hollerin'"" type church for self joy or gratification. These folks are here to please and revere God.
