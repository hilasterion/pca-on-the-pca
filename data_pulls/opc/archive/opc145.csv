Andrew Davis, 5 stars ,"Trinity is a faithful and welcoming church with a mix of young and old families. The worship is simple and pure, regularly consisting of Scripture, prayer, the Lord's Supper. The Word of God, is read throughout the service, as God speaks to His people: calling them to worship, instructing how to live, assuring the forgiveness of sins, and through the expository preaching. Trinity follows the historic Christian faith, holding to the Apostles' and Nicean Creed; as well the the Westminster Confession of Faith produced during the English reformation. Holding to the reformed faith, Trinity OPC teaches that people are saved by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, according to Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone.

If you are looking for a friendly Bible believing church, Trinity is a rare jewel. The worship is not flashy, but the word and fellowship run deep. This is a place where God meets with His people.",4 months ago
Neffa C, 4 stars ,"True to the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, Trinity is also a friendly, warm-welcoming body of believers at a location central to Newberg, but also close enough to the members of communities in the surrounding areas. The service is traditional in that sense but also spiritually edifying and relevant to Christians and others who are slowly being called to serve the one and only true and living God. The body is small in numbers, and so you have great opportunities to truly get to know others if you are willing.",5 years ago
