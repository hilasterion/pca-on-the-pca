B. A. Castle, 5 stars ,"This is my home church.  It is an Orthodox Presbyterian congregation.  That means that we hold to a historic, reformed confession, The Westminster Confession of Faith and Catechisms.  We have worship at 10:30 am with Sunday School right before at 9:30.

If you are looking for a traditional and historically grounded Christianity, come on down!  We'd love to have you join us in worshipping the the Father through the Son by the Spirit.",5 years ago
