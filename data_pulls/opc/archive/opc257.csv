Christopher Segura, 5 stars ,"Great church!  Reformed.  OPC church plant. More importantly, godly, merciful, biblical. They were super warm, inviting, and their testimony is so encouraging in how to live out the Gospel. I knew I was just visiting for the weekend on business and they came to pick me up from my hotel so I could go to their evening fellowship. Solid preaching from the pulpit.",5 years ago
