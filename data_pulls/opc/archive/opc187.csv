Jules Dyer, 5 stars ,"World class preaching & great people! Very laid back & welcoming atmosphere. The pastor & his wife are absolutely awesome people.
No matter where you are in your life, no matter how you dress or what color your hair is (purple, green, blue or natural) you will feel welcome & not judged at all.
You won't be disappointed!!",3 years ago
Kimberly Sumrall, 5 stars ,"We were on vacation from Jackson, MS, and had the pleasure of Sunday worship and fellowship at Covenant OPC. The preaching is biblical, solid, and their view of scripture is a high one. Rev. Watkins obviously takes care to exegete the Bible carefully and thoughtfully. I love the reverent style of worship as well. We also happened to be visiting on a Sunday that they have a potluck lunch and were able to partake with this wonderful group of believers. They have a wonderful nursery set up for our 18 month old and had thought of many details to make it a wonderful experience for parents with young children. If we lived in St.Augustine we would definitely worship there weekly!",4 years ago
