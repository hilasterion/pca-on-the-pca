MARY A, 5 stars ,"This church was truly a blessing to our family! Warm and friendly congregation, especially to ""outsiders"", contrary to another post. Also, they have always allowed you to partake of the Lord's Supper as long as you're a member of a Bible believing church. You don't have to be a member of that congregation.  It has been that way since we joined 4 years ago. They strive to preach the truth in love with Biblically, sound doctrine.  I have made some priceless friendships and will miss being a part of this congregation, since being moved by the military.",4 years ago
David Krauss, 5 stars ,"Outstanding preaching and teaching from a Reformed perspective. If you want to learn the Bible, come to understand the consistency of its message across both the Old and New Testaments, and grow in the knowledge and grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus the Messiah,  this could be your church! The congregation is friendly and welcoming. Opportunities to involve yourself in the life of the Church abound.  Definitely worth checking out!",3 years ago
