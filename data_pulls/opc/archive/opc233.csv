Sam Phillips, 5 stars ,"The congregation at El Camino is a wonderfully supportive community, a true Christian family of brothers and sisters in the Lord. The leadership of the church is dedicated to the faithful preaching of the Word of God. and the regular administration of the Sacraments, which is something I deeply appreciate.
The regular services are Sunday morning at 10:45 and Sunday evening at 6:00.  The morning service is a bit late in the day, but rather convenient for families like mine with little ones; gives us plenty of time to get up and ready before service. The evening service is wonderful, with a time of congregational hymn selections and prayer, both of which are always edifying.",a year ago

Evelyn Johnson, 5 stars ,"People seem genuine and friendly. Very small congregation. My friend has been going there for like 10 years and they have helped her move 4 times without hesitation, a 90 year old church member even showed up to help. She considers them her family. They seem to walk their talk & I love the teachings. Am going back this Sunday & the Sunday's after, hopefully I will find a place to live so I can stay in the area & continue going to this church.",8 years ago
IzandEva Inmyheart, 5 stars ,"This is a wonderful church and tremendous family of believers. I would strongly recommend this church to individuals seeking solid Gospel teaching and enriching Christ-centered fellowship with other Christians. Before moving away from Santa Barbara, I was truly blessed by the Sunday services, morning and evening, as well as the community that this church fosters. This is a vibrant church home conducive for people of all walks of life.",4 years ago

Emily Allen, 5 stars ,It is good to be able to find a truly Reformed Church that focuses on the objective truths that we hold so dear. If you are interested in hearing what God has done for you and how he has done it than you have come to the right place. Simul justus et peccator.,a year ago
