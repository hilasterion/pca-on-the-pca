Jenny Tinnin, 5 stars ,"What a treasure of a church. Every time we attend we are warmly welcomed by Pastor Caleb and many other church members who have a genuine interest in you. There is a beautiful balance of passionate biblical scholars who are full of grace, acceptance and compassion. I am excited to see where God takes this healthy, thriving church family. If you are looking for a church where you can be yourself and grow in the most beautiful way, TO Pres is an excellent choice.",9 months ago
Kevin Marsden, 5 stars ,I have found Thousand Oaks Presbyterian Church to be a warm and inviting place to grow in God's grace. Pastor Caleb is a loving and effective bible teacher. If you are looking for good solid bible teaching and discipleship with an emphasis on the historic creeds and confessions you will love visiting. Highly recommended.,8 months ago
Jim Goddard, 1 star ,"Amazingly unfriendly church.  No one looked at me, gave me the time of day, acted like I didn't exist.  Not going back.",11 months ago
