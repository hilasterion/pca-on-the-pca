Bradley Huenink, 5 stars ,To sum it up Calvary is a church that believes and follows the Bible. They don't add to it or take away from it. The Bible is God's Word and that is foundation of this church. The worship service is traditional with dash of modern. (Some songs are accompanied by acoustic and/or electric guitar as well as violin and a hand drum),6 years ago
