Ane Cook, 5 stars ,"I have attended the worship service now 3 Sundays in a row and I absolutely love it.  The people are welcoming and sociable.  This is a true Bible based believing church.  They‚Äôre true believers of the Lord Jesus Christ. The worship service is Christ centered from beginning to end.  The preaching of the word of God is Biblical, Christ and gospel focused to piers the heart of saints and sinners.  The expository preaching of the word of God by the Pastor is to the point, strong, convicting and excellent.

If you live in SSF or near by and you‚Äôre looking for a Christ centered Bible believing preaching church.  This is the church to attend.

Thank you üôèüèΩ to the congregation for being so welcoming :):):):):):):):):):)",a year ago
Diane Walters, 5 stars ,"This group of believers in Christ Jesus is warm and welcoming to all who visit.  The teaching and preaching is strong and Bible-based.  I highly recommend visiting New Covenant if you live in, or are visiting, the South San Francisco area.  The location is easy to find, close to El Camino Real.",3 years ago
