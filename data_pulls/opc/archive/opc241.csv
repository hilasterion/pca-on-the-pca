Quiroz Sanchez, 5 stars ,"I've only been here a couple times and in every preaching that I heard, the pastor teaches the Bible as it is stated, expounds every verse in a way that is clear and biblical. If you don't have a Church where you can go and you are hungry for God's word this is the place.",2 months ago
