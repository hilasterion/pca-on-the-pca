T B, 5 stars ,"Visited this morning for Sunday morning service while on vacation in the area.  Everyone was friendly, music was theologically rich older hymns, sermon was theological and technically deep, and we enjoyed snacks, desserts, and coffee afterward in the foyer.  There was a nursery room available for parents to watch their own small children in if needed, that had audio of the sermon.  We would attend again.  Thanks!",3 years ago
Ellen Marcel, 5 stars ,We love this church!  The teaching is Bible based and applicable to our real life challenges and trials. And the people go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Christ-filled love and living are present here. As a family we have grown so much since we began attending and sitting under the teaching of Pastor La Belle.  We love this church!!,4 years ago
