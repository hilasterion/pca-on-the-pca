K Seeker, 1 star ,"I fear that this church will become apostate in less than a decade.  The preaching has very subtle liberal and unbiblical messages.  Pray that I am wrong. Very few of the elders know their Bible and doctrine.

It appears that the PCA is becoming more and more liberal and seeking to be friends with the world instead of focusing on following Christ.

I love the PCA but it is becoming apostate.",3 months ago
Valente Gonzalez, 5 stars ,"Greetings,
It appears you left the review on the wrong church page.  This is for Cornerstone OPC in Glenside, not a PCA congregation.  Would you be willing to visit us and update your review?  May God bless you.",3 years ago
Orlando Arnedo, 5 stars ,"Orthodox Presbyterian Church
We learn about the providence of our God his mercy and his sacrifice. We learn the way our Lord is centered and unchaining in our ever changing world.

God is truly in control.
We must glorify him and enjoy him forever.
Amen",2 years ago
Harold Cobb, 5 stars ,"This one is a church were the word of the Lord is being clearly preached. People here are very welcoming and attentive. They really make you feel like part of the family. Me and m family came transferred from Colombia in 2015 for work and found in this church so much love that we drive hours every Sunday just to have fellowship in this family. In 2017 while being on an assignment in Lake Charles,LA we could only come once a month but during my assignment in Port Arthur, TX we are able to make it every Sunday.
The church is formed by people from different places of the world and many languages are represented here.

Me and my family definitely love it.",2 years ago

Richard Otten, 5 stars ,Preaching is expositional so you learn verse by verse.  Clear Law/Gospel distinction.  Congregation is diverse and down to earth.,10 months ago
