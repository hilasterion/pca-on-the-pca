Dan Zuidema, 5 stars ,"I just wanted to relay how much my family and I appreciated the opportunity to worship at Covenant last Sunday night.  This was an extremely welcoming church from my very first contact with them (by e-mail to check on service times).  Love for Jesus Christ was clearly on display!  My older two kids have been studying the catechism for a few years now, and loved the pastor's references to the catechisms as well as his illustrations and the way he addressed them individually.  Praise God for Covenant Presbyterian Fellowship of the Low Country!",2 years ago
