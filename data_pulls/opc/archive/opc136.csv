Jack Christensen, 5 stars ,"Totally a Bible teaching church backed by scripture. No ""milktoast"" preaching here. They tell the truth exactly like it should be. They are also very loving, generous, and amazing church. If you want to REALLY hear God's truth and want to be involved with great people, come for a visit. This church truly practices what what they preach and back it up with people that are there to help and give love and support. Lots of programs for both men and women, young and old, and others that are available to be mentors for those who really need it. There are multiple services during the week that includes Sunday school, home Bible studies, main services, luncheons, dinners, etc. If anyone really truly wants involvement, this is the place to be.",2 years ago
John Gordon, 4 stars ,"These are some really good people.  For a year I lived out of my car and there was more than one night I stayed in there parking lot.  The pastor, Dan, told the sherrif that we had his permission to stay.  Side note, Dan was in a motorcycle accident at the corner stop sign.  He lives with constant pain now.  If he's got an angered look on his face that's only because he is having really bad pain.  I've been to one service and it's an interesting group of people from low to middle income.  Young to old.  No pressure.  The only reason I deducted a star was Dan is a true believer and when he got up to talk, I hate to admit it, but I was a little unnerved with his passion.  This is a purely personal thing but it's my review.  Here's the best part, all the times they helped us they never once mentioned coming to church.  The church behind this one, hired security to keep people out of their dirt parking lot.  I'm a believer but most churches put me out with the pious attitude, not this one.",5 years ago
