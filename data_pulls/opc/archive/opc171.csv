Maureen Bowen, 5 stars ,"Calvary offers traditional, Biblical worship where God's Word is the basis for all that is sung, prayed, and taught. The people are consistently friendly and the leadership is organized, approachable, passionate, and compassionate.  We have been so delighted to see our kids have peers to learn and grow with in the variety of programs designed to aid us in educating our children in the fear of the Lord. The recent drastic growth of the church makes for a crowded Sunday morning, but seeing God bless this fellowship by adding to its number is worth it!",5 years ago
