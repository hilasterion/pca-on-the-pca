Sarah Reem, 5 stars ,"It seems silly to rate a church, but sometimes it's nice to let others know what to expect. Covenant is a very traditional church and the pastor and members are extremely friendly and welcoming. The sermons are thought-provoking and intellectually challenging. The Sunday School classes are usually full of meaningful discussion. Covenant fosters a strong sense of community and service. It is a good church family.",5 years ago
James Robb, 5 stars ,I visited here just recently. The sermon was exceptional. One truly felt that the minister was very knowledgeable about the Bible as he performed his sermon using minimal notes and was never looking for the right word to use. It was a very polished presentation from the Bible and his heart.,2 years ago
