Dan English, 5 stars ,"Friendly, loving congregation in the reformed tradition, but not stuffy. Good mix of old and new music and the coolest sanctuary because they meet in an old Methodist church converted to a theater for use by Creative, a program for the disabled.",3 years ago
Jonathan Hodges, 5 stars ,"I have been several times now and find this to be a very welcoming church. Here are my observations about the style, the music, and the teaching:

Style: They have an interesting blend of new and ancient, modern and classic, flexible and structured. The majority of those in attendance seem young(ish). I noticed there seemed to be a surprising number of small children which indicates the age of the adults. The current fad in Forsyth County is to have a ""contemporary"" (read: 1990s-2010) style, but here they have what most would see as a ""classic"" style mixed with modern/current. As for common dress style, some there were wearing suits/dresses, some were in blue jeans.

Music: You won't hear an amped up electric guitar and Chris Tomlin music from 20 years ago. What they do here is more of a mix of current and classic. So they do brand new music as well as *really* old hymns, all performed on a mix of classical strings, piano, and guitar.

Teaching: The staff here is very direct/clear that they believe the Bible is actually a Divinely authored book. All of the teaching is derived from that foundational approach.

In a lot of ways, I believe this church is still finding their identity here in South Forsyth, but as a church is made of the people and not the building, I give it 5 stars because the people there seem really great.",4 years ago
