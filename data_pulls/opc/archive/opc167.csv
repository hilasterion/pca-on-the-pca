Jim Wadsworth, 5 stars ,"We began attending Emmanuel as a young married couple in 1972.  The vibrant Christian faith, inquiring minds, solid Biblical teaching, and warm friendships were a huge help for beginning Christians.  We have remained to this day and consider some of our closest friends to be members of this church.",5 years ago
Charles Sutton, 5 stars ,"Excellent preaching and wonderful music.  A congregation which cares for one another.
This is the congregation my mom has attended since 1962.  My dad was a deacon here until he died in 2004.  I am always glad to worship at EOPC.",3 years ago
Mary Meyer, 5 stars ,"Emmanuel Preb is a welcoming traditional community with theology that is grounded in the Word of God.  I especially love Coffee Break, the ladies' interdenominational Bible study that meets on most Wednesday mornings during the school year.  We have representatives from Catholic, Presbyterian, United Methodist, Charismatic, Baptist (and more) churches all coming together to study the Scripture, and to love each other with Jesus as our common ground.",4 years ago
Patricia Carson, 5 stars ,"This church had an unbelievable Christmas program with witch they utilized a brass symphony orchestra. They played phenomenal well and we had a delightful time.If anyone is interested in hearing this performsnce, go on line and look up Emmanuel Presbyterian Church. They will be playing in a few different locations. And, it is free! Highly recommend this.",5 years ago
