Ashleigh Mayhew, 5 stars ,"This has been my church home for many years now. The services have a traditional, liturgical feel; the preaching is solid; and the people are friendly. There is childcare available for young children, and they just started a new schedule of a church-wide luncheon once a month…so lovely! It’s a great way to grow in community with your fellow Christians.

I’m excited to see where the church continues to go over the years, and I’m so thankful to be part of this body of believers.",2 months ago
