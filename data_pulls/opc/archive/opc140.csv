Breanna Lum, 5 stars ,"This church is so great!  It has doctrinally sound teaching every week by a well researched Pastor.  The members are very welcoming to new people, and they have great fellowship even though the congregation is on the small side.  Love the hymns and Psalms that are sung each week and that it is a whole family worship setting.  You should definitely check this place out!",7 years ago
