Stewart Whitlow, 5 stars ,"This new mission work in York County is part of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.  The teachings of the inerrant and infallible Scriptures are the cornerstone of the preaching and teaching.  The singing of Psalters and Hymns are utilized in worship along with prayers and classic confessions.  The congregation is small, but growing and very friendly.",2 years ago
Daniel Phillips, 5 stars ,The two things that impress me most about this church are the christ-centered preaching and the care that the preachers have for the people. The Presbytery has worked to send preachers to us every Sunday. Some travel hundreds of miles to lead us in worship and that speaks volumes about the love they have for us and our church.,2 years ago
