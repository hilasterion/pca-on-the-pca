Na Manna, 5 stars ,"My husband and I have been attending the church and we liked the church a lot even from the day 1.
So we have been attending the church couple years.  It was so sad we can't attend the church anymore because we moved far a way (couple hours driving distance).  If we still lived in SF, the church would be our life time church.
The pastor and people were wonderful and very kind.
Also the elders are very respectful and good role model.
Where we live now, we can't find a church like the one in SF.
Thank you everyone and SF 1st Orthodox Presbyterian Church.
The longer we attend and the more we hear about the church, we fall in love with the church MORE.",3 years ago
Nelson's Rudolph, 2 stars ,"The pastor is from Kentucky and has very clear neo Confederate views. He's not a mean person but he believes Lincoln was the tyrant but the slave holders were the good guys.

I never felt so uncomfortable as a marine veteran in my own country. Even a couple of the Asian people acted like they never saw a black person before.",3 years ago
Brandon Gerstle, 5 stars ,"Clear meaningful messages with simple but powerful worship. They have a tremendous heart for all people and a commitment to discipleship. This is an awesome church with warm and welcoming people.
