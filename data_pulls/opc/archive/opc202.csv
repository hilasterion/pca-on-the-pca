Dustin w, 5 stars ,"Wonderful reformed church.  We feel so blessed to have come across Sandy Springs.  Dedicated pastors, and an incredibly warm and welcoming congregation!",4 months ago
Doug Robson, 5 stars ,"The best church I've found that faithfully preaches the full counsel of God with a covenantal understanding of the Scriptures. If you prefer a traditional worship style rather than the more typical modern expression, this church is for you. It stands for a stalwart proclamation and defense of the historic reformed faith - so it's probably the best church available to get a sound, historically orthodox grounding in the Bible. It's relatively small and friendly.  Two Sundays a month, they have a fellowship meal, so it's possible to meet their people and get to know them better. Believers wanting to grow in their spiritual understanding and in their walk in faith could not do better than to join themselves to this church.",9 years ago
