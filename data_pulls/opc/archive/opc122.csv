Sean Ballard, 5 stars ,"this church is filled with genuinely loving people!

and beyond that, there is no watering down Jesus and God at this church. They will give you a full dose if you ask for it! Just how I imagine Jesus would've delivered his message and teachings. XD #righteous. Do not hold back your questions! All the members are extremely intelligent, passionate, and well-read.

I cannot say enough good things about my experience here.

This is how I imagine the original Christians were like, and why the gospel was spread across the world.

I cannot recommend highly enough!

They've inspired me, and give me hope :)",6 months ago
