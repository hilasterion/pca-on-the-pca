David Austin, 5 stars ,"Pastor Wagenmaker is a gifted preacher, teacher and explains the subject matter fully and understandably. It's obvious he studies the subject and prepares his sermons over the week (not at the last minute).
The service as a whole is well rounded, has Christ as the focus, and communion is explained so all can understand. There is no muss or fuss, no choir or organ; however, there are people singing with the piano earnestly desiring to worship  Him simply in truth and spirit.
There is always something to snack on afterwards and a potluck once a month. Always a bunch extra for visitors :)
The people are friendly, genuinely care about everyone and their wellbeing. Just a great place to learn about God, our relationship with Him and to each other.",3 years ago
