Vincent Silva, 5 stars ,"We were just there September 2021, and we found a congregation that was very warm with their hearts.  They welcomed us with loving arms, and a very sweet couple invited my wife and I to their home for lunch and fellowship.  That was totally unexpected but it showed us how the love of God is expressed through the body of Christ.  We hope to return again soon.",a year ago
