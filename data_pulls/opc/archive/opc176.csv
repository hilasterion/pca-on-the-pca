Michael Boysen, 5 stars ,"As the son of a Lutheran Minister, as well as a student of John MacArthur and his Grace To You Ministry for almost three decades, I sought long and hard the last several years to find a truly Biblical and doctrinal church--not just in what they say but in what they do and how they conduct themselves.  So many synods, districts, and churches are caught-up in entertaining the masses with watered-down singy-songs, watered-down, user-friendly services, short, shallow, watered-down sermons, and the ""tickling of the ears"" that Paul talks about, giving attendees what they want to hear vs. what God commands and demands.  And even some of the supposed, apparent, traditional, orthodox churches simply succumb to the world and the world's ways in what they do and how they conduct and govern themselves.  All in all, most churches simply try to reinvent the wheel and Wolf River Presbyterian and the OPC does not and it is as simple as that--they believe in God, His Word, and HIs Son Jesus Christ and it shows in everything they do from teaching to preaching to conducting worship and the ""business"" of the church.  As christians, the Bible should be our guide in all things and it's not mythological here and there or antiquated as some pretend but it is God's Word and it's our guide for how to live our daily lives as well as how to run a church, how to worship, etc. and this church and synod adheres to this simple principle and does it right.  It's not hard to figure out how to conduct things in this regard but humans just make it hard when they think they know more than God does and don't obey God's Word and try to invent new and user-friendly ways to worship and live our lives when God already laid it out in His Word.  I believe today's churches range between disasters to complete disasters in these regards but Wolf River Presbyterian is a complete refuge and gem that is quite rare around here and probably anywhere else.",8 months ago
