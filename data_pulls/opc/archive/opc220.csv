Diana Jenkins, 5 stars ,"Been a member at this church for 9 years. I grew up in the church and, I believe, have been a Christian my whole life. I have grown and matured more in the these last 9 years, sitting under such faithful teaching and preaching, than the previous 20 years of being a Christian. No church will ever be perfect, this side of Glory, but the leadership here humbly desires and strives to faithfully preach the whole counsel of God & properly administer the sacraments.",3 years ago
Katy W., 5 stars ,"We love this church. Pastor Paul is a gem among gems: a loving and kind shepherd, who earnestly seeks to properly preach the Word of God. Before the Lord led us to Branch of Hope, our biblical doctrine had been spotty at best. The teaching at Branch of Hope helped us to lay a solid foundation to understand and study God's Word and to trust in the Lord alone for our salvation. We became and stayed members of Branch of Hope for over a decade, and would have stayed there until the Lord took us home to glory, if employment changes had not taken us away. I pray that the Lord continue to bless His work through Branch of Hope for many, many years to come.",6 years ago
