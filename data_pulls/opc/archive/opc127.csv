Maria Jeantet, 5 stars ,"If you're looking for a church that's biblically sound, rooted in God's Word and friendly, loving people then look no further, RRF is the place to be. I have loved being a member of Redding Reformed Fellowing all these years - the teaching, the growth and understanding of our relationship with God, it's been pretty amazing! Pastor Gene has a high view of scripture and reverence for the Lord, he loves his congregation and his sermons are life-changing! I invite you to come visit, we meet every Sunday at 10am.",5 months ago
