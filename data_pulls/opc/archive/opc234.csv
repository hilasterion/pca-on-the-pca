Kaylen Steele, 5 stars ,"We have visited this church a few times over the past couple years when we are near Escondido for the weekend, and are so encouraged there.  Everyone is so welcoming!  We had two different families hand us hymnals already flipped to the right song, and when we accidentally left some things at the church this past weekend, the church staff was so kind and graciously mailed it back to us.",2 years ago
