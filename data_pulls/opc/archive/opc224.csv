Hannah Depew, 5 stars ,"Great church for Christ-centered and Reformed teaching and strong Christian fellowship. As an Orthodox Presbyterian Church, they hold to the Westminster confession and catechism. The sermons are always a blessing and full of Biblical truths. The congregation is intimate and friendly to first time visitors and regular attenders alike.",3 years ago
