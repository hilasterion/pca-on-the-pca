Clara McGinnis, 5 stars ,"I am a new member at this church.  The preaching is excellent (very Scriptural) and I love the fellowship.  If you are looking for a church that focusses on worshipping God and hearing His Word, than you will like Sovereign Grace.  I also like that the congregation is very friendly, genuine, and close.  We aren't just ""church friends"" here but get together often as friends for other activities.",a year ago
