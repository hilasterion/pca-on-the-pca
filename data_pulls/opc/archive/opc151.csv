Jon Miller, 1 star ,"This church is good for someone who is willing to conform and not ask questions. I have spent 10 years in the university studying the Bible, church history, Biblical Greek, and Hebrew and know how to have an educated conversation with someone even when I disagree with them. Rev Curtis, on the other hand, does not. On our third visit to this church, when we tried to converse with Curtis in his office, he became hostile and, at one point, took a step towards my wife with his finger pointed in her face. His attitude was narcissistic and communicated that he has no interest in anyone if they are unwilling to agree with him. On the other hand, elder Richard is polite and professional and displays a kind and caring spirit",3 months ago
Jeffrey Gresio, 5 stars ,"Mr Miller,
Your review is inappropriate, inaccurate, and an egregious violation of the 9th commandment. My hope is that you will prayerfully consider removing it and contact me if you wish to address the matter in a more biblical, Christ honoring manner.
