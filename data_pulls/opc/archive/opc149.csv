Kyle Morse, 5 stars ,One of the few churches in the area in which you can both begin and end the Lordâ€™s Day by worshiping with other believers as they still have a service at both 10:30am and 6pm. People from different backgrounds with diverse interests brought together through the love of Christ and fed solid teaching both in Sunday School before the morning service and in the preaching of the Word.,a year ago
