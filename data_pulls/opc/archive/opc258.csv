Rosana Correa Araujo, 2 stars ,"Today I was so excited to reconnect with my church, as I am a member baptized in another state , I thought as I just moved to Austin , could be welcomed by this church, that I left it with my heart broken.  I am not sure if the coldness is from Texas people or the church members itself.  Unfortunately I felt there so alone and empty, as a Christian member , we have to embrace each other without any discrimination or disqualification on the Godâ€™s presence.  Well I will continue looking for the warmest church that will be accepted me as part of them.  ðŸ˜ž",3 weeks ago
