Alex Carson, 1 star ,"The doctrines and creeds from the Reformation that are professed here have almost nothing in common with the early Christian's views on salvation and Orthodoxy. To call 17th century innovations ""orthodox"" is to intentionally misrepresent the teachings of the apostles and early church.",a year ago
