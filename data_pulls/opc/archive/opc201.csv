Alex Holowko, 5 stars ,"The only reformed church in the area that has consistent in depth biblical exposition. Gospel focused, following the historical Westminster confessions. Conservative and reverent in worship of the triune God. Sweet fellowship of dear brothers and sisters who care and love others. Typically Sunday worship service has a fellowship meal to follow.",10 months ago
