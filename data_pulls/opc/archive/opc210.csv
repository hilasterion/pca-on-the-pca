Steve Consultant, 5 stars ,"The church is an excellent one, giving glory to God, and worshipping Him in spirit and in truth.  We were members for two years, and enjoyed the warm fellowship and generous friendship of the church and its members.

This is a mid-sized church, well established, with members of all ages and walks of life, singles, families with children, professional, and retirees.  It is worth noting that the church leadership reflects that breadth of background and experience.

Highly recommended for a visit and particularly if you are looking for a good church.",2 months ago
