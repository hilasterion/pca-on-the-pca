Benjamin Thompson, 5 stars ,"Christ Presbyterian is the most biblically faithful, gospel-centered, Reformed place of worship in all of Flower Mound. The people are warm and friendly, the preaching is always excellent, and the worship is solid and biblical. While I and my family ordinarily attend a PCA church outside of Flower Mound, we have always been blessed on our occasional visits here.",6 months ago
Paula Ea, 5 stars ,"Christ Presbyterian Church has been a blessing to our family for over 15 years.  They are a worship centered, gospel loving and family friendly congregation.  While they offer a nursery, the pastor often says that hearing a baby cry or a child speak too loud does not bother him.  This greatly encourages the early training of reverent worship for our children and we have always appreciated that aspect of CPC along with countless other aspects.",4 years ago
Timothy Skaggs, 5 stars ,"We have appreciated the corporate worship and the proclamation of the Word of God the last several Sundays.

Update: ‘Church life’ means a lot to different churches. However, instead of reinventing the wheel, instead of just playing copycat some mags church to bring the same result, church life at CPC is intended to mirror the early Christian church. Coming along side hurting brothers and sisters, seeking, rejoicing, caring burdens, learning, and worshiping with like-minded believers is a focus of CPC. They gain their script from the Bible and the relevant historical church life. Give it a try!
We were not disappointed.",9 months ago

Tyler Eakin, 1 star ,"I deliver bounce houses for a living. The group next door was having an event on Sunday, April 8th 2018. We just needed to park our truck and trailer in their barely empty lot for 10-15 minutes. They promptly kicked us out. How Christian of them. If I can't rely on fellow Christians for some help, something it's wrong.",4 years ago
Jamie Braden, 5 stars ,"Tyler, forgive us for the delay in responding back to you, as we just became aware of your review.

My name is Adam and I spoke to the morning that you are referring to. Our muslim friends next door at the mosque that you were delivering to were having a festival of some sort on that Sunday morning. As we talked about that day, our request that you not park on our property wasn't a personal attack on you, but rather a matter of respect to us as we worshipped on the Lord's day. You were the third delivery person that pulled trailers into our parking lot that morning and it was noticeably disrupting our Sunday School classes. This is why one of us came out to address the situation and it happened to be you that we talked to and asked to move. Afterwards, you still felt the need to come into the church in the middle of our worship service to express your disappointment to us.

Like I told you then, I'm sorry you felt that way, but I didn't think it inappropriate, unloving, or un-Christian for us to ask that you respect our worship time, especially since there were other parking options including the High School and the mosque itself. We allow our neighbors to use our parking lot as overflow every Friday and since the incident we've spoken with them and they will strive to respect us as we worship the Lord Jesus Christ on Sundays.

Honestly, I'm surprised that you took the time to give a negative review for our church considering that when we spoke, we explained ourselves and apologized for the inconvenience. I want to express to you that we love you just as we love our neighbors. Our desire is to proclaim the Gospel and show the love of Christ in all areas of life and I personally apologize if we failed to do that. We are repentant sinners who have been forgiven and saved by our loving Savior. I hope that you will extend forgiveness to us and also hope that you might join us sometime to learn, serve and worship the One, true, and triune God.

Sincerely yours,

Adam",3 years ago
