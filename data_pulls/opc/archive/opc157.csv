Luke Walkup, 5 stars ,"I love this church! I became a member here in May of 2011 while I was attending West Virginia University. The preaching of the Word is edifying and Christ-centered as the pastor constantly points our hearts heavenward. I have found the people here to be friendly and hospitable. I hope people find me to be the same. :)

I hope that you come and worship the Lord with us and grow in knowledge and love.",5 years ago
