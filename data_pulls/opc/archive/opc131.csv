Victoria Wang, 5 stars ,"A reformed church with orthodox doctrine and vigorous worship!  I became a member after visited for about 5 months.  I enjoyed the Christ centered preaching, Westminster Confession of Faith study, growth group fellowship and prayer!  Plus our singing is also an indispensable part of our covenant community!",6 months ago
Michael Majchrowicz, 5 stars ,My wife and I have been attending this church for about 12 years. This is a wonderful church family that has been incredibly welcoming. We wanted a Bible-believing church with strong preaching and a more traditional style of worship and that is exactly what Covenant has.,7 months ago
Miguel Alvarado, 5 stars ,Solid expositional preaching that is faithful to Reformation principles. The pastors take the time to explain the context of the historical backdrop of any given passage. Theologically stimulating and yet at the same time evangelically warm. The people really care about each other and they live out their faith in practice.,7 years ago
Dawei Lan, 5 stars ,"Excellent teaching, people are concerned about each other and the local community.  Many members are involved in jail ministry.   The church is used by Assyrian and Chinese congregations.   If you want to get a flavor for what the church teaches, listen to Pastor Landis on ""Wisdom for Living"" on KFAX.",9 years ago
