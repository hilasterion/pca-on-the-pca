Tai Wong, 5 stars ,"Wonderful time at 10 am for Sunday service with worship filled sermon and a time of prayer that starts before the service to prepare those coming early to prepare for a time of meeting God and His people. Encouraging and supportive to all attendees followed by a time of fellowship after the morning service. Plan to stay after for the fellowship! Evening service starts at 6pm and also fellowed by a time of encouraging and supportive fellowship. Wednesday evening at 7pm has a midweek service that also teaches how relevant our faith has survived historically and much more. Bring your family and friends and enjoy hearing His Word, explore and share in His grace, truth, love, and fellowship and renew your heart, mind, and soul with one another. Grace Church at 1448 Standford Avenue has a low power FM Radio station to broadcast it morning service and proclaim God's amazing grace locally and on the Internet as well.",3 years ago
