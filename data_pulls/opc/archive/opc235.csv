Marnie Lux, 5 stars ,"The people here are the friendliest, warm and accepting Christians. They know their Bible and theology and the Pastor and his family will give you tough love and guide you to the straight and narrow according to Godâ€™s Word. Accepting everyone as loved by God and worthy to be taught and held by the church community there.",a year ago
