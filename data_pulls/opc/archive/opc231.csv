beth o, 5 stars ,Sunday morning and evenings The Bible is taught book by book and not by the common topics dealing with popular thoughts.   The Pastor is grounded in scripture and is very humble in spirit.  All the members are kind and the church is very welcoming and friendly. Lots of age groups and lots of chores ages 10 to newborn.   I recommend this anak church highly,a year ago
Chelsea C, 5 stars ,"Ben is the best pastor I've had! He loves his Fox so much, sometimes I'm worried you'll have a heart attack",2 years ago
Ben Rochester, 5 stars ,"The pastor is always going on about the need to revive the church of the east San Diego County and doing so by recovering to a biblical ministry, Spiritual life in Christ, and church fellowship reformed back to the system of doctrine taught by the original Apostles. Other than that though, the snacks and coffee are really good.",5 years ago

dianne mccormick, 5 stars ,"Hi Ruth! Sorry to hear that you did not have a good experience. However, you are reviewing the incorrect church. We do not have services open to the general public at this time due to Covid-19 closures. We are meeting for worship, but for our members and regular attendees only.
We humbly ask you please consider amending your review to reflect the correct church you attended.
Thank you and God bless.
