Ruth Keller, 5 stars ,"Great Presbyterian Church. I've visited several times over the years; the staff and congregation are friendly and helpful. I'd say the pastor is energetic but thoughtful. The music is mostly hymns acompaied by their grand piano. Idk how they do Communion because I usually go to evening services. They have a nice church library with a small variety of Christian books.

If your looking for a smaller, close knit traditional church this is a great place to go!",2 years ago
John Douglas Chitty, 5 stars ,"Mid-Cities Presbyterian Church is a congregation of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church, a theologically conservative body which confesses faith in the Scriptures as expressed in the historic Westminster Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms.

The church is located in Bedford, Texas, a great location in northeast Tarrant County off Airport Freeway and Northeast Loop 820, making it accessible to families from the greater Dallas area as well as the greater Fort Worth area.

Mid-Cities Presbyterian is a smaller congregation, allowing opportunities to form close relationships so members may “love one another” as Christ has loved them, with no fear of being lost in the crowd and merely a number to the Pastor, Elders and Deacons.

The church’s faith and practice is rooted in eternal truths, not contemporary trends. A typical worship service is simple, yet liturgical.   The preaching of the Word of God is central, but the service is bathed in prayer, the public reading of Scripture, the administration of the sacraments of the baptism of believers and their covenant children, and the monthly observance of the Lord’s Supper. The congregation itself is the choir, which heartily sings the great hymns of the Christian faith from all generations, giving the worshipper a true sense of worshipping with the whole church, past and present, with the living saints on earth in all nations, and those reigning with Christ even now in heaven.",4 years ago
