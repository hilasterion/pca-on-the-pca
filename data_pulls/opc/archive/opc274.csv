Spirited Today, 2 stars ,The lack of diversity is disturbing. Maybe not a complete red flag but definitley an increasing concern.,2 months ago
Alexis Schaefer, 5 stars ,"Spirited Today, thanks for taking the time to look at RPC's Google Profile. We are grateful for your zeal for diversity in the Church of Jesus Christ. We give thanks to God that his church is composed of people of every background and ability and we are glad to bear the marks of that diversity in age, sex, class, education, ethnicity, and even language. As our church grows, we hope and pray that the Lord will build us up as a diverse, but unified body and equip us with members who know and make regular contact with the full diversity represented in our community, all with the singular truth of Jesus Christ, who unites us with his love. We invite you to come to one of our worship services to participate in our praise of the God who is both one and three, the fount of all unity and diversity in this created world of his.",a year ago
