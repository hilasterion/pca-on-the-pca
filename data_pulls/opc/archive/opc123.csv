Andrew Davis, 5 stars ,By far my favorite church! I recently became a member and look forward to going every Sunday! Very high view of scripture accompanied by serious and rigorous approach to understanding it. Gospel centered preaching. Approachable pastors. Incredible reverence. Friendly people. A great place to grow and fellowship!,4 years ago
