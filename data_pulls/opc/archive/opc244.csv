Matthew Holloway, 5 stars ,"I'm a member here. The congregation is loving, the preaching is Christ centered, and it is a great place to worship God. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good and Christ centered church. The pastor, Jeremy Boothby, is very good at answering any questions people have and is very knowledgeable about the Gospel and knows what he is talking about. The elders are also really good about keeping in touch with the congregation and also caring for them. I love this church.",4 years ago
