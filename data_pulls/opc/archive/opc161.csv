Mortimer Snerd, 5 stars ,"A solidly biblical group of people from a Reformed perspective who follow and love Jesus as Lord and Savior - and express that devotion without hesitation. A good mixture of young and old and equally blessed ethnically, they are true to the Lord's message of redemption - and as a result, this community of believers doesn't take that message for granted nor flippantly and seeks to live it out in all it fullness amongst the urban part of Dayton that they've been called in making disciples ""of all nations"".  In our search for such a fellowship such as this,  I can truly say we have found a home.",11 months ago
