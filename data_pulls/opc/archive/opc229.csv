Doug REID, 5 stars ,"Reformed congregation was friendly and the preaching / teaching was simply  excellent. The Pastor has years of experience and it shows in his sermons & his delivery. If you think a large ""drum kit"" and an excited drummer are essential for worship you'll be disappointed by their absence. This church also doesn't need traffic monitors or shuttle service because of its modest size. If you are thirsting for the Word of G-d delivered by a Godly man in a competent way then you can stop looking for a good church: You've found it.",3 years ago
