Lucas Baumbach, 5 stars ,"Great historic mill church now the home of a growing congregation. Lots of children and families! This church was built to serve the Taylors Mill community. Conveniently located on Main Street, there's still no excuse not to go to Church in Taylors. The preaching is some of the best expositional preaching through one book of God's Word at a time. The congregation is multicultural and friendly. The music is congregational singing with piano. You should visit this gem, if you haven't already. Sneak in the back and be ready to be greeted by someone.",2 years ago
