R Schll, 1 star ,"I have high hopes for the future of the people of this church. However, I have a responsibility to tell my story so that others may be aware and, hopefully, lean into difficult issues and help make this a better place. All I actually want is to work things out and delete this review and leave a happy one.

Leadership at this church destroyed my friendships and reputation, excommunicated me based on lies and without a trial before the elders, and silenced me in every way, including deleting any / all of reviews I attempted to post on Google. Trauma I received from them, since some were very close friends I have known for almost a decade, caused a major breakdown in my health and in every other way. On top of this, they sent dangerous lies about me to my family and created a crisis situation that could have taken my life.

There are a few good and sweet people here that are not involved in all of this, but overall, I believe that this church is highly toxic because of the system and because of the way core people view me and others like me. This congregation places an outward emphasis on diversity and “the Gospel.” But I have personally seen much evidence that they are not committed to that and are instead putting on a show from which they financially and reputationally benefit, drawing in new members and dollars. In fact, all these attacks on me began when I advocated for listening to and caring about local BIPOC-led community groups to some elders and their wives and the board of trustees in July 2021 and the following weeks.

Beyond myself, there are so many people in the community and beyond who are looking for the healing, inclusion, and shalom that the power of the real Gospel brings. I hope transformation happens sooner rather than later so that this church can get to work on truly loving everyone and being concerned for and working for their needs, some of which are desperate and urgent.

We are all God's children, and should see and treat each other as such, with family love. And it heals the world. May the Lord bring us all that love and healing.",7 months ago
Rschll, 1 star ,"This place is not what it seems. They have lied about me, destroyed my reputation and friendships, caused trauma, health crisis, family crisis, and have threatened legal action to keep me from telling what I know about them. All I wanted was to talk about things, forgive, and continue loving each other as family and help the community with urgent needs, like Jesus says. But I have been silenced in every way and treated with various forms of violence, though not yet physical violence. I hope and pray for reconciliation, the power of the real Gospel's shalom, and better days ahead.",6 months ago
