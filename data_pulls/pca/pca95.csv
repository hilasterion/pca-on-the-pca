David Johnson, 5 stars ,"I am very thankful for this church.  I attend when I'm in town for work and am always very blessed.  They have a very nice, welcoming location, spirit, and layout.  Pastor Mike has always presented a very compelling, biblical message that is challenging, faith building and edifying.  I especially love how multicultural it is.  People from many different cultures and ethnicities worship together there - so encouraging.  They are also bilingual - english and spanish - presenting everything in both languages.  In my mind they are a model church.  You would do well to make it your church home!",3 years ago
