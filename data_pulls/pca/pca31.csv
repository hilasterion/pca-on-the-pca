Hector Caceres, 4 stars ,"We went for a wedding. The venue was very nice the church was well kept. It's a large compound with several buildings on the lot. There doesn't seem to be much in the line of parking, but you can park street side or around the back in a small lot. There is also some parking available some of the time by the James Brown Arena, although during events that parking is off limits.",5 years ago
