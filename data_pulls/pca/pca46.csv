Tonya Wallin (Tonya Gifford), 5 stars ,This church is very beautifully big wonderful amazing and so awesome for any wedding!!! But so sorry I had to find out about this beautiful church because I had to attend a wake service they provided for one of their own and I must and have to say it was truly amazing the whole service spoke and reached out to my heart and so many others they truly did an amazing wonderful job and the receptions after oh man the food was so so great everyone loved it and many of the family and friends took several plates home with them I just have to say truly I am honored and truly blessed to have been part of this church family and friends that did an amazing awesome wonderful job for the Hudgins family that I would 100% put my word on the great and honorable job they all dis for Mark Hudgins may he rest in peace but this wake/service you all bestowed upon him and his family was just truly heavenly just like he and the family deserved I can't imagine what you all's normal church services and the preachers sermons are like after I witnessed what he and  the congregation does with a wake for someone from his/their congregation!!!! I'm telling you this church and the people in it are beautiful amazing and wonderful and special!!!,2 years ago
Andrew Alms, 5 stars ,"This is my home church and my family; we are focused on reflecting the kingdom of God in a gospel centric community that is as serious about diversity and justice as sound doctrine (hint: one in the same ;). We have a lot fun in worship and fellowship, too. Come join us!",3 years ago
Darnell McGavock Sr., 5 stars ,"A Church of Sound Doctrine, that is not a physical building.  But people who believe the true Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.

The building the Church worships in is a vast facility.

If you go here, you will hear Jesus preached in truth.

They are not ashamed of the Gospel.  For it is the Power of God to Salvation.",4 years ago
Caleb Aikens, 5 stars ,"Can't stop! Can't stop! Praising His name!

Man, if you are looking for moody Presbyterians with somber reflective worship experiences with soft lights and a few hymns thrown in, go elsewhere. If you're looking for preaching that sounds like Dr. Foreman of Covenant College at 8:30 AM, go somewhere else. These Presbyterians are woke with the Holy Ghost. The hope for God's sustaining hand and joy for what God has sustained and prospered is on display with a central attitude towards the gospel, even when things can be really tough. I love being a member here.",3 years ago
