Thomas Swaim, 5 stars ,"I think Frankly Frank said it very well ... a humble pastor (and gifted preacher) who understands Gods grace and preaches a solid (reformed) message.  People are kind and serious about their faith.  Don't let the ""humble"" facilities (former furniture warehouse) mislead you.  There is exciting and wonderful worship, and Biblically sound outreach, taking place inside those pre-fabricated metal walls!",5 years ago
