Zachary Curtis, 5 stars ,"Very healthy church with many children and young people. Wonderful preaching and teaching true to the reformed faith. My family has been so blessed to be a part of this amazing church family. Ever since our first visit over a year ago, we have felt like family here. These are people who love God, and it shows through how they love those around them. The senior pastor, Paul, has been particularly special in my life and growth as a Christian.

Can’t say enough great things about Zion. Come and see!",4 months ago
