Judah, 5 stars ,Very warm and welcoming body of believers.  If you are new to Lakeland itâ€™s especially important as they will quickly plug you into the fellowship - a welcome change from what we are used to in the church sadly.  Also and equally important they share in a worship service that continually reminds you that we worship an Awesome and Holy God.,9 months ago
diane jones, 5 stars ,The congregation is warm and welcoming. There is no doubt that this Church is truly Bible-based.,4 months ago
JOHN KESLER, 5 stars ,"I loved this Church. The service was dignified, reverent and always pointing to Jesus Christ, not us, as the One responsible for our salvation.
The music was inspiring and Christ centered, not man centered. The sermon was powerfully delivered and Bible based. No pop psychology. And the people were very friendly and welcoming.
Do I plan to return? YES!",a year ago
Jonatan Martinez, 5 stars ,"Good faithful preaching, well structured liturgy, good Sunday School classes and well led by its session. No church is perfect but their emphasis on maintaining the unity and purity of the church makes this an excellent church to attend.",3 years ago
Tommy Forrest, 5 stars ,Friendly and outgoing. Solid handling of the Word of God by the pastoral staff. Worship that honors God. Family integrated (children welcome to stay in main sanctuary).,2 years ago
FrPaul Armes, 1 star ,"The pastor's name is, ""Doctor Drama"" and he has his stage hands (the church session).  He has to be a good actor in order to cover up his corruption.  Humility and forgiveness are in short supply within the walls of his dark theater.  His mentor, the ""Drama Queen"", left town and left him speechless, without a script.  The seeker is better off finding a church which began in 33AD rather than 1646AD.   Caveat Emptor!  Rating: 0000",4 years ago
Dustin Young, 1 star ,I went to this prek school for orientation and was confronted by the rudest people ever. After I left they called DCF and had them do an investigation on me and had never met before. Dcf came to my house out of these peoples vengeance!!!! Its a disgrace and not safe for your children to be there. The principle was quick to use all the little power she had and I will be finding an attorney to sue these people..,2 years ago
Agnes Rodriguez, 4 stars ,Just dropped a grandson off for an eagle scout court of honor and it was a lovely facility inside and out. But not a church service going on just as social to celebrate someone's accomplishments.,3 years ago
