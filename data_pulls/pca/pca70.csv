Olivia Williams, 5 stars ,"I have been a member of Trinity Church for many years and have found it to be a loving, caring community in which to grow in my walk with Christ. I and my family are grateful that we can be confidant that the preaching from the pulpit and the teaching in the Sunday School is always Biblical. Also, there are so many opportunities for fellowship and to use the gifts God has given us. Trinity welcomes visitors and has special classes for them to explore what our church is all about. I would encourage those looking for a church home to visit our website to get an overview of all Trinity has to offer!",5 years ago
Clint Carroll, 5 stars ,"When looking for a church 4 years ago, I desired to be a part of a community of believers who loved one another and, more importantly, a church that preached the gospel-centered truth about God's word.  I wanted to raise my family in a church that made the receiving & sharing of the gospel of Christ the most important goal of life.   Through congregational worship, mid-week bible studies, small groups, and various children ministries, I have experienced the rich love and support from our community of believers and been fed the truth of God's word.   Please come and join us at Trinity Presbyterian Church.",5 years ago

Rob Godwin, 5 stars ,"25+ year member
Church’s #1 priority: preaching & teaching God’s Word
Huge, positive impact on my family, especially through Children’s and Youth ministries. My children knew more about the Bible when they left for college than I did until reaching my mid 30s.
Loving congregation, especially when you are hurting.",5 years ago
