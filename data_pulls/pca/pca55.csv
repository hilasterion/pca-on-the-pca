Karis Needham, 1 star ,"Preaching and teaching is based in historic reformed doctrines. Emphasis on an active Christian faith where the members live, work and play. Large, well-organized children's ministry that involves parents. Supports many Nashville ministries, multiple overseas missionaries, partnered with sister churches in England and Ireland, and closely involved with low income areas nearby. A church truly engaging Nashville with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.",4 years ago
Laura Stacy, 5 stars ,"I was speaking with one of the teaching pastors from this church when he said some really hurtful things. He insinuated that rather than focusing on the hurt I felt, I should focus on the blessings of God. The hurts he wanted me to ignore were devastating—wrongful deaths, decimated homes, and abuse. When I called him out on it, he promptly stopped discussing it with me.

If this is the kind of pastoral “care” and “teaching” that this church allows and operates from, it is not of Christ. Telling someone to ignore their abuse and just “forgive and forget” only furthers the cycle of abuse. Telling someone to thank  god for their blessings when their home was just decimated is privileged and ignorant and does nothing but further hurt the person. It is not of God. Ignoring racism in the world and shrugging off the pain people have due to a racially motivated death is not of God.

Due to not only the harmful things said but also the unwillingness to even engage in conversation about ways that this pastor has been hurtful leaves me unable to leave a positive review of this church. Be careful learning from Scotty Smith.",10 months ago
ChaCha W., 5 stars ,"Karis, we are so sorry you had a negative experience. We believe that sin corrupts every aspect of human life, and we grieve for those who suffer abuse, racism, hunger and loss. While we long for the day when abuse, sorrow and death will end, we also seek to do what we can to work for peace, justice and wholeness today. Please let us know if we can help you in any way.",4 years ago
