Justine Dale, 5 stars ,"This is ""my"" church....rarely miss going on Sunday.  We have a new pastor who is very real and kind, and cares that his ""flock"" gets the truth of  Christ.  His sermons leave you wanting to draw closer to the person of Jesus who gives us the opportunity to really live.  The former pastor is still on staff performing a vital outreach to the ill and shut-in and preaches about once a month. (Love his Heart)
