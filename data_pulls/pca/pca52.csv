nathaniel morefield, 5 stars ,"WHPC is a wonderful church, with great family and such friendly people. There is such an ""iron sharpening iron"" type of feeling,  that you are always prayed for cared for and loved! They are a great option, family friendly and the sermons are focused on the heart of sin that we all have. Pastor Andy doesn't preach just on what sin is, but our hearts of sin, and how Jesus Christ paid the penalty for it",4 years ago
