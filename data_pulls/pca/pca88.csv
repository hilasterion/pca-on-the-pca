Will Stevens, 5 stars ,"My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting this flock for their 11am service. We were warmly welcomed by volunteers and deacons (even though we were scrambling in late with twin babies!). We were offered different options to sit and were even brought chairs to accomodate us and our bulky stroller. When our girls started getting a little rowdy we stepped out to the volunteer staffed nursery (although not one, single individual made us feel like we had to) and our girls enjoyed some fun toys and space while we listened to the Pastor preach from the lobby speaker.

This seems to be an outstanding church with multi-generational involvement - young families to teenage kids to more seasoned believers - where everyone is lovingly interacting before and after service. As newcomers we felt welcomed, met several individuals including Nat, one of the deacons, and his family along with the Associate Pastor Randy, and others (I'm sorry I'm so bad with names!).

If you're local and want a biblically sound church with strong community ties, one that turns to Scriptural integrity with the commmitment to really living it out, pray and consider this church as a home. To those visiting, this is an outstanding option to pop in for a Sunday or two. You will be made to feel welcome, with their people recognizing that you are in fact a brother and sister, even if Treasure Coast isn't where you call home.

My wife, two daughters and I all look forward to visiting our in-laws again and popping back in here as God allows!",2 months ago

Serious about living out our faith. You are welcome!",4 years ago
