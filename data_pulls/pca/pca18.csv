Kathy Noonan, 5 stars ,"Our daughter works full time in the offices there, so we are very familiar with the church and its parishioners.   It's a wonderful, loving place with good solid biblical preaching and teaching and warm and friendly parishioners.   Visitors are warmly welcomed and followed-up with.  And we are always welcomed as family.",a year ago
Didi Wong, 4 stars ,"So full disclosure: This is a review by someone on staff so obviously biased =) I didn't give my own church a 3 because I think I reserve that for the church body as we experience it in heaven.
We are certainly flawed people who need Jesus every day of our lives. But I also know we are a group of people who are genuinely trying to follow Jesus in a broken world. This church is a church who wants to share the love of Christ and who wants to create community with one another. We have our strengths and weaknesses but I certainly believe we are worth a visit. People make decisions about finding a church home based on such different reasons and preferences. Nonetheless I hope if you visit you will find warm and welcoming people who are seeking to know Jesus more and live out their faith more powerfully and authentically.",10 years ago
Chi Wang, 5 stars ,"I've been a member at the Church of the Good Shepherd (CGS) for 9 years now and immensely enjoyed (and still enjoy) both regular services and special events that have been held at CGS. David Bowen, the senior minister, along with his staff have delivered and continue to deliver insightful sermons that reach both those seeking Christ and seasoned believers of Christ. CGS has a enjoyable blend of both traditional hymns and contemporary Christian music for Sunday worship and we've got a great set of volunteers who help greet, seat, and even pray for both new and returning visitors and current members of the church.

Moreover, CGS has hosted several amazing community events from the Behold the Lamb Concert to Chili Cookoff and even a good ol' Southern Pig pickin'!

In the Durham/Chapel Hill area, there are other good churches but I haven't found one that surpasses CGS in terms of solid teaching, great mix of worship (both traditional and contemporary), and amazing church fellowship.",10 years ago
