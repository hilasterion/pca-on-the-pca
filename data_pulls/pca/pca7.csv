Brian “B” Laws, 5 stars ,"Church of the Redeemer seriously consists of the nicest, most loving group of people you could hope to meet. You truly will be welcomed and brought into what really is a family. Nobody and no church is perfect, and Church of the Redeemer is no different. However, it embraces the fact that we all need Christ and understands that even the redeemed need a _lot_ of growth. Are you broken and in need of grace? If so, welcome to the family!",a year ago
