Tracmae Treasure Chest, 5 stars ,The children always have a great time at the different events. I'm glad they have a heart for outreach and bringing in the community. My family has also enjoyed Sunday morning worship here as well as marriage ministry classes.,4 years ago
Robert Rosser, 3 stars ,Their covid19 protocol is too exclusionary for me. Having to make reservations a week in advance just to get to attend a service in person. Will keep searching for a church family here in my new neighborhood.,a year ago
desporado, 5 stars ,"Redeemer has three things I love,#1 The word of God is taught chapter by chapter and verse by verse!.#2 Redeemer is walking worthy before the Lord! Here at Redeemer we pray for our city and our neighborhood  but we also roll up our sleeves and work, we have ministries that reach multi generational people.such as evangelism and  spiritual growth groups Sister Cooks,Upside Down and Pipeline . We also have ministries that rebuild the neighborhood such as missions to Broadmoor #3 )We live out our faith by loving one another! Redeemer has shown me love from the moment I walked thru the doors.They have prayed with me,encouraged me and even rebuked me when necessary for my spiritual well being. Redeemer open doors for me and my family that changed our lives forever I LOVE REDEEMER",5 years ago
IcameIsaw S, 3 stars ,"I've never been, so this review is for the school. Actually my son has never been enrolled in the school, but my following statements will give a better understanding why I'm leaving this review.

On April 10th I had a scheduled interview so my son could gain possible entry into the school. I heard so many wonderful things (really just from 2 people) and the proximity to our jobs were a plus. I had been looking for years for a fitting place for our son, so I was excited about just getting an interview.

The interview went well, at least for me. Was never really told about my son's separate interview so I assume it went well. People were nice with a warm reception upon entrance.

Now that was April 10. Fast forward to May 4, still no word. My coworker had a child there as well, and she thought it was odd that so much time had gone by without any update. She suggested that I call them to see what the delay was. I contacted the lady I had previously emailed concerning the delayed feedback and and she basically told me to be patient. So I was patient... a bit too patient. April 10th turned into June 9th without any type of communication. [Keep in mind that this is my only child, so I'm trying to do the best I can on my own (busy husband) trying to find schools and navigate processes in a timely manner.] When I reached out to them on June 9th through Facebook, I was informed that letters had already been sent and I should've received one (not verbatim). WHAT LETTER? On June 11th, it was finally confirmed through facebook that my child wasn't accepted nor denied but was place on a waiting list. So what is a mother to do during summer when most schools start accepting in the spring.

I literally sat at my desk and cried because it took me almost a year to even find that school, how long will my next search take me? I work full time and in the last semester of completing my MBA.. where would I find the time

Thankfully, I was able to find something even better. Expensive, but I think I can adjust to it.

The reason why I decided to write this review is to ask powers at be to have another way of sending out information. I still wasnt given a clear reason as to why I didnt receive a letter. The only explanation I got was ""..somehow lost in translation."" What does that even mean? They didn't say ""lost in the mail"" they said ""lost in translation"". Even after the fact, I still haven't received a letter stating that he was placed on a waiting list.",4 years ago
