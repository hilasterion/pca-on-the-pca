William King, 5 stars ,"This is a beautiful building. But, the people are even more inviting. The members of this church are warm and friendly. They are welcoming and inviting. I was blown away by the gorgeous interior and it is beautiful.  If I was looking for a church home I would definitely consider Southwood. Go visit and see for yourself.",3 years ago
