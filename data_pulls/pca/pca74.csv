Cherry Moreno, 5 stars ,"This is a very friendly church in a lovely district of town. We live in the neighborhood and stopped in for a visit and were so welcomed. They keep the grounds beautiful and have a very active youth for families with children. The pastor gave a very intelligent and passionate sermon that really resonated. I am not a big fan of some of the ""rituals"" and repetitive but the whole of the experience was delightful.",6 years ago
buddy eades, 2 stars ,I got a room at Paradise bar and Grill but you’re not guaranteed a parking spot in front of your room I had to park across the street,7 months ago
David Grove IV, 4 stars ,"A great, friendly place that has been a wonderful alternative to Halloween. It was quite a safe place during hurricane Ivan. God bless.",a year ago
Mark Roche, 1 star ,"Services and events are great, but it is hard to recommend a place of worship when several of the staff members have taken advantage of situations for personal gain. In my opinion your church is only as good as it’s staff as a whole.",3 years ago
