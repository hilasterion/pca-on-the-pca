Matthew Andrychuk, 2 stars ,"Attended consistently for about a year. Sat in a small group for a while. The people are kind and friendly, however they are indoctrinated with Reformed Theology. The errors of this church are:
A. Infant baptism
B. Replacement Theology- denying a literal view of bible prophecy and throwing the nation of Israel under the bus.
C. Elected Leaders- in the Bible God calls men and burdens them with ministry. Nowhere are they elected. This allows politics and a traditional doing of things in the church among the presbytery rather than being Spirt led and prayerful.
Traditions over cremation, predestination and even the ESV(retranslating of the RSV) hold this church in error.
*Potshots are taken from the pulpit on dispensationalism and Charismatic views, misrepresenting them. When you call to speak to a pastor they give a 5 minute conversation and then hang up.
Hymns are good. Appreciate the devotion of the choir, but the tradition. Reformed Theology= Roman Catholicism repackaged.",a month ago
Theresa Williams, 5 stars ,Very welcoming congregation. Great youth group leaders and children's programs. Members are very service oriented and make you feel like family.  If you are looking for a Christian church definitely worth checking out.,4 years ago

Marni, 5 stars ,"We transferred membership from another local PCA church early last year (2021) due to an aim to relocate, and my family and I have been truly blessed in doing such. The teaching is solid, under the shepherding of Rev. Kevin DeYoung, and we are finding that even though it is such a large church - community can be found (even for introverted personalities).

Multiple ways to connect are available:

• Sunday Schools for adults, youth and children
• Small groups
• Youth Ministry
• Children's Ministry
• Women's Ministry
• Men's Ministry
• GriefShare
• DivorceCare
• Trail Life
• American Heritage Girls

The culture here is warm, friendly, caring, and helpful...dedicated to helping others and meeting them where they are in their lives, and it is seen in the development and installation of their lay Biblical Counseling training they've been engaging in since early 2021.",2 months ago

Lauren Keyton, 5 stars ,I absolutely love this church. The Word of God is preached faithfully and truthfully. This church family is so welcoming.

C Mack, 1 star ,"Although the sermons are usually spot on, I once received very evil treatment by the pastors of this church (namely under Michael Ross). The truth of those events was swept under the rug by the elders and pastors and deacons. Therefore I give you 1 star. I understand that the current pastor has nothing to do with this. However, it is his responsibility to investigate the allegations and deal with those in authority. Most of those involved moved to other PCA churches. One of them was fired. If you join this church watch your back. The bigger families join together to take control here (especially if they have money). My story is 1 of many. Believe me there are plenty of stories!",3 years ago
