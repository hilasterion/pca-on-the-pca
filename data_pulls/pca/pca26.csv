Matt Watson, 5 stars ,"A loving and encouraging (Hebrews 10:25) congregation which prays for one another and remembers the Lord's Day, praising the Lord ""from the rising of the sun to its setting"" (Psalm 113:3). Here, you will not be malnourished with more of the world but will be constantly pointed to the Bread of Life (John 6:35)...our Savior and Him crucified (1 Corinthians 2:2). The pastors and other elders are sacrificial and committed to the flock. Come (yes, come!) and you will discover expositional preaching rooted in the God-exalting, Gospel-centered theology of Scripture, a membership which lives and breathes as the Body with Jesus as her Head, and a steadfast commitment to the Great Commission. ~ Psalm 34:8 ~",a year ago
Josh Giles, 5 stars ,"If you live in the Mt. Pleasant area and are looking for a church, you need to consider this church.  They  seem to worship God in spirit and in truth (except for the infant baptisms ;) ) and preach the gospel in season and out of season.",a year ago
