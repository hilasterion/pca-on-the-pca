Ana Velez, 5 stars ,"TPC is a church where you’ll find deep, expository, hermeneutical, exegetical teaching. The elders, deacons, and their new pastor are very rooted in scripture. Not only do their own upwardly faithfully preach the Good News each Sunday, but they also are imitators of the word in their own lives. If you’re looking for a church where scripture is respected and taught but also it’s being visibly seen in people lives. TPC is that church.",2 months ago
Cisco YMD, 5 stars ,"Truth Point is amazing! My wife and I have been attending Truth Point since April 1st of 2018 after that first cost we decided to be attendees of the church because of the Solid biblical Teaching.

We have grown so much since we started to attend. Then a few months ago we finally decided to take that life long commitment by becoming members. Today, this very day. My wife and I did our membership ceremony.

We are very happy and blessed to be apart of a beautiful beautiful of believers.... A family!",3 years ago
