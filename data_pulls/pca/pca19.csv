Victoria Gerken, 5 stars ,"PCA Church (the same denomination as RC Sproul, Legionnaire Ministries) Biblically sound teaching that is founded in the conservative teachings we held dear in the church before it was liberalized by our society.  It's comforting to know I can visit this church and hear the same teaching as in my home church.  It's a small thing to some, but I still want to say ""Our Father"" vs. ""Our Creator"" when saying the Lords Prayer.  I also like to know that my pastor is a teaching elder, his views have been scrutinized by a board of elders in our denomination and that was completed prior to his occupying the pulpit.",7 years ago
