Ultra Violet, 5 stars ,"While I can't vouch for any of the spiritual kool aid they may proffer since we are non religious, I can thank them for the marvelous outdoor resources they offer from nature trails to the track to the pond to the playground to the obstacle course and community garden. Their lush beautifully landscaped grounds are open to the public so they can be enjoyed by all.",7 months ago
Cindy Bundy, 3 stars ,"Hey! We're so glad you're able to enjoy our resources and hope you'll join us for one of our outdoor events in the future, as well as any of our services each Sunday",4 months ago
Ludivina Villasana, 5 stars ,"I came as a mom of a soon to be junior CIT,  she loves camp more than anything else. The sermon was good but long.  The congregation was very cold. I am sure they donâ€™t like it when we come as outsiders but, they could at least be nice to new people.",2 weeks ago
Carrie O'Leary, 5 stars ,Hi Cindy! I'm sorry you had that experience. That's certainly not our aim. Our typical worship services are around an hour and fifteen minutes long. We allow extra time on Camp Sunday for some additional elements that are unique to that day. We hope you and your family will join us again soon.  - Debbie,6 months ago
Carole Wheeler, 5 stars ,Perimeter church is a very community oriented church. Their teaching is biblical sound reform theology. But if you are looking for a perfect church... This is not... There's not such a thing as a perfect church. I hope one day they will become more diverse.,5 years ago
Martin Leckie, 5 stars ,"We love attending Perimeter. In fact, we do much more than attend! We are involved in JHI ministry and childrenâ€™s ministry which has allowed us to join a community of parent and family believers. This has deepened our walk with Christ and provided opportunities for our child to meet and develop friendships with other believing teens. Love this place!",a year ago

Perry Abel, 5 stars ,"It's almost as big as a mall. The pics I took are mostly the children's classrooms and hallways. Attended a needlework crafters stitch-in and meeting. Very nice, clean and modern facility.",a year ago
Gerry Marathon, 5 stars ,"Perimeter Church is a place to really grow spiritually. The pastors do a great job with sermons, there is a great kids program, the school is wonderful, worship team and choir are top notch, and discipleship is really big here. The church does so much for many communities and impacts several nations around the world. I am proud to be a part of such an amazing church!",a year ago
Daniel Nam, 5 stars ,"Hey Martin, thank you so much for your encouraging words. We are so glad to have you part of our family.",a year ago
Tim Beard, 5 stars ,"Big church with a small church community if you make the effort to get plugged in. Very welcoming people, in our experience. For all my life I have known God had a plan for me, but I really couldnâ€™t have dreamt of a place that felt like this. From the moment we arrived we were met with smiles that felt sincere. We have been blessed with a Church family and community that have blessed our lives more than I can say, and more than we deserve. Weâ€™ve learned more about Godâ€™s Word in the last 6 years than we have in the previous 30, and I went to a Christian University. ðŸ¤£ If you make the effort to meet people, go through the membership process, utilize the resources offered (like discipleship, connect groups, Momâ€™s groups, womenâ€™s ministry events, etc.) you can experience what we have. Itâ€™s an incredible body of believers, and weâ€™ve seen God work through it more time than we can count. I (obviously) highly recommend.",10 months ago

Ty Lawson, 2 stars ,"Just had a recommendation for the church. Can their be a offering basket or box setup so that people who want to make offerings physically can do so? Not much to ask, but I would greatly appreciate if this could be implemented in all the services.",3 years ago
kotzting, 5 stars ,"Hey Daniel - thanks for the great recommendation. I'll pass it along to our leadership. Have a great weekend!

UPDATE: There are black boxes on the wall outside of the Bookstore and Security office where you can drop off a physical offering. We will continue to look for other options.",3 years ago
Anne Goulart, 3 stars ,"As good as it gets. Incredible facility, rock solid teaching, great programs for youth and kids. This is a great, well-rounded PCA church.",8 months ago
Katie Timberlake, 2 stars ,"Perimeter is an excellent church. They have sound theology, great worship services, and fabulous pastors. There is a teaching team at Perimeter where pastors rotate and you get to hear teaching from several different people. There are also several different venues in which to worship: the chapel, the main auditorium, and the hanger. The children's nursery and discipleship are fabulous!! My children have thrived at Perimeter Church. This church cares very much about helping you grow in your faith. It's a large church, but they have many ways to get involved with a small group.",3 years ago
Kieran Mayer Dollarhide, 5 stars ,"Visited from Nashville during my weekend Atlanta stay and what can I say, this place is nice! I loved how positive, happy, and friendly people are. Yes this is a huge congregation with a concert like stage, but there are people from many walks of life here to listen to a great Gospel message from a tremendous pastor. The sermon that I heard was about grace and always being reminded that God always loves us no matter what. I came away with ""God may be disappointed in some things we do, but he always pours His blessings down on us. So let's do things that make God happy! Let's live more in sync with Him! They have a coffee shop and parking people outside too! I came away from service with a stronger understanding of justification of faith. Keep it up y'all!",3 years ago

Charles Meeks, 1 star ,Camp all American is quite possibly the best summer camp in the world and perimeter church is the host. Looks like they are doing a great job at pursing excellence and it shows. Very friendly staff and the worship here is solid. A+,2 years ago
David Hancock, 5 stars ,"Very click, especially their 20s Group. No greeting from others, people believe they are better and more superior than others. Got a list of leaders who are a bunch of rejects and staffs as well. I feel bad for that one disable guy getting ditched out from the group. These young adult need to be discipline properly. Seeing a lot of people not digging in the word. It's not a church like environment, but more of a gather around. Also it takes forever to get a membership right there. Best to look elsewhere if you are to look for a good church community.",7 years ago
Raj W, 5 stars ,"I have attended Perimeter Church for 34 years. Few churches anywhere consistently display the marks of a true church as does Perimeter. The word is preached, members disciple one another, the Gospel is shared, global missions thrive, and the local community is served. BTW, we are not a ""MegaChurch."" We are just a rather large church within many small groups of friends inside, no cliques.",4 years ago

Ed Keibler, 5 stars ,"Even though it's kind of a megachurch, the solid teaching by Randy Pope and others is Biblically-based yet Seeker friendly -  not ""Christianity-lite"" like others in the area. Lots if opportunities for connecting, growth and ministry. Laura Story is one of the music & worship leaders.",4 years ago

Mikki Smith, 5 stars ,Went there many years ago before the new campus.. judgemental and mean spirited.. obviously they have grown perhaps it's different now..plus I discovered I didn't agree with Presbyterian theology..not the place for me..I honestly don't know why I went in the first place..I got nothing out of it..,2 years ago
