Mitchell Summerlin, 5 stars ,"My wife and I have been visiting this church.  The pastor is warm and engaging.  The congregation is friendly and welcoming.  You don't have to wear a mask ( in the 10:45 service).  Most appealing to us is that unlike many churches now, you don't have to fill out a form to attend worship, like people did in Stalinist Russia.",2 years ago
