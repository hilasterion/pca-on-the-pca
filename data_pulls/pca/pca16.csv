linn crowell, 5 stars ,"CCG is a family that is always open to more of God's children. This church desires to serve each other and the community as Christ has loved us. There is genuine humility and repentance among the leadership that encourages all of us to live according to the Gospel.  Pastor Jeff is a wonderful, caring shepherd who faithfully teaches the Bible.",a year ago
Jay Easley, 5 stars ,"CCG is a great place whether you are a single person, student, or married with kids.  I have found it very welcoming and non-discriminatory in all ways.  It has brought me closer to God and it has strengthened my faith.  It is a great community to belong to.",7 months ago
Becky Feldmann, 5 stars ,"We have been attending CCG for almost 3 years now. You won’t ever find a more humble and kind-hearted pastor. God has blessed Pastor Jeff with the gift of being able to break down scripture in a way that is applicable and understandable without watering down the doctrine. He never raises his voice or yells, which my heart appreciates. We aren’t a huge church, which I also like. Everyone knows each other. Our four teenage/young adult children enjoy the Sunday messages, Bible studies, book clubs, fellowship, and the youth activities. All the church children and visitors’ children are loved and nurtured by caring Sunday School teachers. When I first came to CCG, I knew it was a place I could learn about Jesus and connect with His people. I love my church and invite my friends and coworkers often, because I want them to see what makes CCG so wonderful. Please come visit us sometime!",a year ago

Emily Reynolds, 5 stars ,"CCG has some of the most friendly and down to earth people at any church I've been to. The sermons are meaningful and the Head Pastor is very humble. There are lots of opportunities for growth and community. They have small groups, womens ministry events, community service events, mentoring, and so much more. Over the summers they have supper clubs where you can prayerfully get partnered up with people you don't know to make friends. This is not the kind of church where you walk in and out just on Sunday mornings. This church is multi-generational and diverse. They preach the  gospel and live it out.",5 years ago
