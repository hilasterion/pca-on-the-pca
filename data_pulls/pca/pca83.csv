Truth Defense Ministry, 1 star ,"I attended Pine Ridge regularly as a reformed Christian for over a year a few years back. I liked it a lot and met some good people there. I had just gone through a divorce with my ex-wife and I was seeking church membership. I brought my little boy with me whenever possible. I was also getting plugged in with youth groups, bible studies, etc. One day the pastor asked me to noticeably sing during worship, as I tend to be more on the quiet side when it comes to worship. Shortly thereafter, the pastor calls me to tell me not to return. This was incredibly odd, as I did nothing wrong and I wasnâ€™t rebelling in any way, shape or form. To this day I honestly donâ€™t know why I was told all of a sudden over the phone by the pastor not to return. Strange.",2 years ago
Eric Burket, 5 stars ,"Pine Ridge is such a loving group of people. The people really show Christ's love and are very warm and welcoming. It's not too big, but not too small-- it really feels like a family when I'm there. Pastor Bill's teaching is phenomenal-- I've never heard a pastor preach Christ in such a personal and meaningful way.

Plenty of small groups and weekly activities to get involved with, from children up to adults. There are great children's programs with volunteers and teachers that are very kind.",8 years ago
Kay Orr, 5 stars ,"The people at this church are so warm and welcoming. The teaching is theologically sound. It is an hour from our house, but if we lived closer we would make this our church home.",a year ago
GiveIt Legs, 5 stars ,"This little church is fantastic! It's the perfect church for young families, who are looking for a comfortable, family atmosphere, and not necessarilly the giant 'mega-church' vibe. Great senior pastor, with really sound doctrine but 'down-to-earth' practical wisdom in his messages. Cool place.",10 years ago
