Josie Marie, 5 stars ,"My family had the opportunity to visit Wayside as visitors. We were warmly welcomed. The preaching was faithful to scripture and Christ centered. The worship was beautiful. I would highly recommend any family living nearby to visit, or if you are passing through to take the extra minutes and drive up to visit!",3 years ago
Sherry Duncan Moss, 5 stars ,"If you enjoy a smaller church (though growing rapidly) where you can really get to know folks & you like reformed, expository preaching & intergenerational worship, please join us! In addition to worship services, we have Sunday School divided by ages, Sunday evening Vespers, Men's & Women's Bible studies, small groups with childcare provided, missions opportunities, and youth/family gatherings. True community!",a year ago
