Linda Edwards, 5 stars ,"This is one of the most beautiful and big church buildings I have seen in a long time.  I went there to their bookstore after evacuating to Birmingham, AL from hurricane Ian.  Found it on Google.  The bookstore is very nice and has a lot to offer.  Go visit, if you are there.  Everyone is so nice.  If I ever get back to the area, will go back for sure.",2 months ago
Daniel Shevchenko, 5 stars ,"We visit here on a regular basis. It's nice. You can come, mingle in the crowd, worship, and go home. No one wants to pester you. We're even able to find a nice spot in the balcony where our young children aren't a disturbance.",5 days ago

"BL Chambliss, CSCP", 5 stars ,Opposite of Liberal wokeness. Sola Scriptura is lived here. Jesus is preached and his gospel is humbly delivered weekly. You can also tune in to the Moody Radio Network through Briarwood radio station. Very extensive missions program. Reaching Birmingham to reach the world for Christ.,5 months ago

Jenny Hope Marlow, 4 stars ,No church is perfect.  Never have your eyes on a pastor or teacher or you‚Äôll never stay anywhere and people will fail you.  Your focus has to be on Christ and His word.  Every church is flawed the second you or me set foot in it.  We are all sinners and fall short of the glory of God.  The church can be a tad liturgical and the hymns are great but there would be nothing worldly about mixing in some music that is rich with the word of the Lord and contemporary.  The preaching and teaching leans toward a Calvinistic view but is sound. If you look around on any given Sunday there is a need for more diversity but I think a lot of it is the area surrounding the church.  The men (and women) serve well at briarwood.   BCS is mission oriented.   I‚Äôm thankful for the ministry of briarwood!,8 months ago

Lisa Shores, 5 stars ,"The Police force they have clearly shows that there is no seperation of church & state. Lawmaking should have used science, reason & logic, but instead we are heading to #theocracy. First it was the ban √§bortion law, then it was first amendment violation for only allowing christian monuments on state grounds but no other religions are allowed, to now this police force. Our state has gone full mad.",3 years ago
