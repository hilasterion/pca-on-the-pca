Tasha Ann, 2 stars ,"The preaching was detailed and thorough, that is not what I am rating on.
The only person who greeted us was the usher who handed us the bulletin. Not a single  person looked out way & smile, shook our hand, or said hello.

The bulletins are helpful and a good resource for new comers, hence the 2 star rating, instead of 1 star.

Be aware they do actively believe and practice  baby baptisms & sprinklings.",2 years ago
Denise Burkhart, 5 stars ,Easter praise worship service. Had wonderful music and great fellowship and food afterward. Such a blessing to visit this church.,7 months ago
Kim M, 5 stars ,We attend another church but I heard Pastor Doug Agnew on WHVN Radio so we decided to visit.  He is a solid preacher/teacher who is down to earth and funny.  You can tell that he loves his congregation.  Everyone was very friendly without being fake and pushy.  Bible-based preaching and God-honoring worship.  The sanctuary had a very peaceful atmosphere where you can draw closer to the LORD.  I recommend this church to anyone who wants to grow and learn.,4 years ago

Alexander Ellenburg, 5 stars ,"Honestly. People here come to me, looked me in the eye genuinely, and thanked me for coming. Now I don’t need thanks, but people here are just warm and genuine. They’re not there for a show, they’re there to learn and be with each other. As an outsider- this is the place you want to take root and grow.",5 years ago
