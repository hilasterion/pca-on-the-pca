Jim Moore, 5 stars ,"I am a member and part of the leadership. Here is what I like about our church. We are part of a presbytery, which means we align ourselves with other groups of churches. As a small church, we benefit from the programs and resources of larger churches but make all church decisions locally. Since we are relatively small (30 families) we are open and friendly. Most of our folks serve the church in some capacity. We have the 70/100 rule where 80 percent of the people are doing 100 percent of the work to run a church. We are a Scripture based church in that we believe the Scriptures are truthful and reliable. Our worship is contemporary but not loud or a show. Parishioners all participate in the singing and worshiping of God. We do sing hymns but often with a contemporary style.",3 years ago
Frankly Frank, 5 stars ,"I've only visited once mostly because of distance, but the worship was positive and the people were great and very receptive. The church seems like a warm, loving large family of Christians. Lots of kids too!",4 years ago
