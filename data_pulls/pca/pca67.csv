Patricia Jackson, 5 stars ,"Riverwood took my children, the 3 nephews, under their wings and loved on us when needed to that God children really cares. No every church have church folks we all have stay away from them kind in the church.",4 months ago
Johanna Bosley, 1 star ,"Bereans Beware! They seem nice at first, but you'll want to keep these folks at arms reach. Mean-spirited and poor representatives of God's grace and love. Not to mention poor analysis of scripture, poor theology, and poor apologetics. If you can't go for study and you can't go for community, well you might as well just pray at home with your family. And in fact, it seems like they have a history of excommunicating the people they don't like anyway.",7 months ago
Tanz Moody, 5 stars ,Friendly congregation and leaders. They preach the gospel message.,3 weeks ago
Jacob Bell, 5 stars ,"I've been a member here for years, and I love this community of fellow believers. It's a PCA church with a solid foundation in Reformed theology and liturgy.
They have been a family to me and welcomed me/supported me while I was in college. Truly, it is a church that has exhibited the love of Christ time and again, for me and many others.
I recommend going to their website or contacting the Riverwood offices if you'd like more information.",2 years ago
