Andy Wertz, 2 stars ,"Interesting church. I ventured here after I moved into the area. I hadn't done enough research to see that this is a PCA church and not PCUSA. That means they are not open to ordaining women, LGBTQ people etc. Definitely not for me. But I could see how a lot of people enjoy the sense of community I saw.",4 weeks ago
Bob Kidder, 5 stars ,"This 200 plus year old church is well off the beaten path. However, that beaten path will lead you to a church, a congregation and a pastor who all work towards putting God first in their lives. There is a genuine sense of community. Both members and visitors are welcomed at the door by people whose love for God is evident with each greeting. This is one of the few churches I have ever attended where the congregation makes it a point weekly to extend themselves two fellow members of the body, as well as, visitors. It is a wonderful thing to not only observe but to participate in. The pastors love for God and his word or immediately evident upon his move to the pulpit. He exudes God and his love both your prayer and thoughtful study of scripture which is evident in each sermon. For me personally, it is a privilege to be among such dedicated Christians.",11 months ago
