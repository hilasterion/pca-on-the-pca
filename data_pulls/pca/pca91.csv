Christian N, 5 stars ,"We just started coming here a few months ago, and as a lifetime church goer I have to say, this pastor is probably the best preacher and teacher of the Word I have ever seen. His sermons are really incredibly good and he is so clear and smart and makes each sermon into a valuable teaching moment. I takeaway so much from his sermons, more than I ever have before, Iâ€™m also learning more than I ever have before. He is a thoughtful teacher and you can really see God speaking through him every week. Truly anointed. We also never feel awkward or unwelcome coming in as new comers each week, which is also so refreshing. The beautiful worship time is so nice and so filled with the Holy Spirit. Their outreach in the community is also something that is so amazing and unmatched in my experience in the area. A great church and welcoming environment.",5 months ago
Nita B, 5 stars ,"Myself and my daughter came to this church for a few months while in Fort Lauderdale and we miss it. We just moved back to our home state and this is really the thing we miss the most about our time in Fort Lauderdale. Really top notch pastor and worship team, the worship team will blow you away and we just loved coming here. Amazing   church really.",2 months ago
Michael Buonaiuto, 5 stars ,"I've been attending Rio Vista for just over a year now. I really like the small group that we meet up with on Tuesday nights. I appreciate the dedication to having a coffee hour in between services. I feel welcomed and comfortable to share my struggles with church leaders...even to the point I am going to attend couples counseling with the associate pastor, his wife, and my girlfriend.

The worship is good. Very predictable. Never too rocky, never too sappy. The sermon (no matter who is preaching) is always introspective. Pastor Tom was a lawyer and my future father-in-law said he thought Tom's message was laid out like a case. I guess that's true sometimes but for me, it's more of an easy to listen to guy sharing what's on his heart and pointing the answer to the cross.

There are consistently events happening at the church like game nights, young adult nights, men's breakfasts, rallies, worship nights...and they're just about to open a new building next door that I'm really excited for.

Rio Vista is in a beautiful part of town and I feel truly blessed to be part of a church I can lean on like a family.",3 years ago
Danny Pedraza, 5 stars ,"The community at Rio Vista church are amazing! There is an actual family aspect from each ministry when you walk through the doors that are genuinely welcoming.  I love how intimate the worship is, and the messages never disappoint by them applying to anyone.

This is a MUST try for anyone looking for a church home!",3 years ago

Timothy Newcomb, 5 stars ,I travel for work and have only been to this church a couple of times but the service is excellent and the sermons are phenomenal. Of the times I've gone the sermons have spoken to me and my life but also seem to speak to the community as well.,5 years ago
