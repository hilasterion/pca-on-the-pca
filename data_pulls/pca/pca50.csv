Lance King, 5 stars ,"I've been a member of Covenant Presbyterian Church for about 6 years now, and attended regularly for about a year prior to that time. The pastor, elders and deacons have been kind and friendly toward me since my very first visit to the church during a difficult time in my life. I have never seen anyone turned away from worship for not being a member of the church. Even during our monthly Lord's Supper (communion), the pastor explicitly invites any believer who is a member in good standing of ANY Bible-believing church to partake in the elements. Nobody is turned away.

Every Sunday morning during announcements a warm welcome is extended toward visitors, and the church bulletin states: ""A SPECIAL WELCOME TO OUR VISITORS! We are happy to have you worshipping with us today. If you are looking for a church home, we hope that you will considering becoming a part of the Covenant Church family."" Of course, joining the church is not a requirement for attendance.

I don't know who the person making this claim about the church turning away non-members is, but their statement is simply wrong. If they were misinformed by someone in the church, then I would invite them to come back and see the true hospitality routinely extended toward visitors.",7 years ago
William McNinch, 5 stars ,"My wife and I visited Covenant Presbyterian of Oak Ridge recently and received a very warm welcome from the congregation.  The Pastor and his wife made a special effort to speak with us and asked us to return.  This particular Lord's Day was a fellowship meal Sunday and we were invited to stay and eat with the congregation.
The historical worship liturgy was dialogical and God honoring.  The Gospel was clearly preached from the Scriptures of both the old and new covenant.  The table and font of sacrament was clearly visible to the worshipers.
Within days of our visit we received a wonderful personal letter from the Pastor thanking us for visiting.
All in all, we were very pleased and will return without question.",6 years ago
Jonathan Sharpe, 5 stars ,"In response to J. Rose's review, I can only guess that J. Rose may have perceived some slight because of the practice of fencing the table of the Lord's Supper, which is practiced throughout the Reformed churches.  This is taken from 1 Corinthians 11: 23-34, is done in obedience to the Scriptures and out of compassion and love for all who worship with us.

Any and all visitors are welcome and encouraged to worship at Covenant Presbyterian Church.  I can say this from personal experience for when I first came to worship at Covenant, I had not even been baptized as a Christian, yet was warmly welcomed.  Any and all questions or concerns I have had about the Christian faith have been addressed here with wisdom, warmth, and compassion.",5 years ago
J Rose, 1 star ,"I don't know where to begin. My family was denied to worship at this church because ""You are not a member.""

There are other Presbyterian churches to choose from, find another.

Never in my life have I ever been denied to worship at ANY church.",7 years ago
