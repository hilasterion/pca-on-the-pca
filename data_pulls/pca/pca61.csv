Mad Piper, 2 stars ,"Truly friendly people but I did not hear the Gospel here.  The lesson was from the Old Testament, surely nothing bad at all about that, and we had references from the New Testament epistles.  The word from Philippians  come close in it reference to Christ, but still, nothing of Matthew, Mark, Luke or John.  Not even a Gospel reading!",a year ago
