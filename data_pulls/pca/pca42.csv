neil bohannon, 5 stars ,"My wife and I love this church! Have been here 4 years since moving to the area and have found the folks there warm, supportive, and caring. More importantly, God's Word is taught consistently and carefully we believe, in line with conservative values. The people there are varied in many ways and a testimony to the power of Christ for anyone in all walks of life. Worship is very meaningful and peaceful, with traditional, time tested hymns filled with instructive and comforting words. (as well as some newer great hymns.) We highly recommend this church and welcome anyone to visit!",2 years ago
Kim Tweten, 5 stars ,This church is a place where the Bible is preached and done so with humility and the understanding that no one is perfect but we all need help and hope.  This church has been open over the last few months during Covid.  They have been careful to allow a space for those who choose to wear masks - it’s a separate space and with the air on and Chairs distanced.  They have social distance measures in place In the main chapel and continue to offer communion in both spaces.  It’s a great church and even in this time of separation they exude warmth and friendliness.,2 years ago

Brett Charap, 2 stars ,"Honestly, pastor Schmitt is a good preacher, he teaches sound Bible doctrine, but the congregation is cold, unfriendly and you really don't feel the spirit there. Went for nearly 6 months and didn't make one connection. It's a shame really.",3 years ago
Daniel Powell, 5 stars ,That is a shame. Sorry to hear that was your experience Brett and that we failed to show the love of Christ. We would love to hear why you think that was - could we get coffee or could you write us an email? Like to learn what could be done better.,5 years ago
