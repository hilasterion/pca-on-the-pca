Audrey, 5 stars ,"A beautiful and welcoming church! Kirk O' The Isles puts aside the unnecessary bells and whistles of most modern churches and instead keeps things simply about worship, study, and fellowship. I always leave refreshed!",3 years ago
Elaine Pierce, 5 stars ,"Kirk of the Isles, PCA.  This is my home church and I've been a member for the past 12 years.  We have a wonderful pastoral staff who are professional, studious and talented in preaching  the Word. They seek to serve the needs of the congregation.  Our church seeks to minister to the needs of the community around us. The people of the Kirk are friendly and will welcome you.
Come and hear the Word of God preached without fear or reservation!  You will be blessed.  Sunday School starts at 9:30 and worship service starts at 11:00 AM on Sundays.",9 years ago
