Non-member Anonymous, 1 star ,"1 STAR:  As a former member of Uptown I loved to worship there, I love the people there; I had found my home.  I helped plan church retreats.  I was in life group.  I went to events after work, volunteered for the nursery, bible studies, etc.  I was connected, giving my all, all of the time with how I could.  I even supported a family each month, donated to trips, etc.  It turned out not to be enough, and I wonder if everyone is required to be heavily involved or asked to leave the church?

I’ve wanted to reach out for a while and say this:  please love your congregation better.  You don’t know what someone is going through.  You shouldn’t fault someone for being private vs asking others to pray for them.  (I was ultimately faulted for privately grieving.) Unfortunately, I had the fear of being a gossip topic if I shared my pain, that news around town could have impacted my job, or even worse, to be asked specifics about how I was handling .... when I didn’t want to publicly show emotion.  It took everything in me to attend church service when I did (and I did), but I also terribly missed regularly attending while in the mix with my friends there.  At the time I wasn’t strong enough to face others with tears in my eyes.  Everyone deals with pain differently, whether as an introvert or outwardly.  Uptown was the one place where I should have been able to grieve in the way I was capable of, share my hurt upon being ready, and get back to myself with Uptown to still belong to. When you’re in you’re in, but if you can’t be in the mix regularly, I guess you’re out?

A pastor had contacted me to say I hadn’t been attending service and I should consider a new church (after going about once per month down from each week over prior years).  He said my membership would be revoked. I explained that I never left, but he was firm on his position.  The exchange was seemingly graceless on his part, not even a hello, and I did not feel comfortable returning after all that was said to me.  It didn’t end there though.  More than a year later the same pastor sent me a handwritten letter on fancy stationary to my home.  He told me that I should find another church bc my membership was already revoked for not being a good fit at Uptown.  Each occurrence left me baffled and quite hurt.  I’m a deeply private person and a Christian, yet not a fit?  Then soon after that, an elder whom I didn’t know kept emailing me, in a harassing manner with inappropriate questions as well.  Mind you, I hadn’t been there in close to two years at the time.

The whole situation of being rejected from a church that I never left wasn’t exactly fun.  That occurred during one of the hardest chapters in my life.  A large part of my world had crumbled, and for things I couldn’t control.  While I’ve forgiven, I’ll never forget how my (then) church made circumstances harder on me.  If someone clearly loved Uptown (like me) and became withdrawn, you should remember there is (was) probably more to their story.  Not for nothing, I hope this doesn’t happen to someone else.

As for new members, unfortunately, beware.  I still love the people there and I always will. However, I never thought I’d experience what I did, at a place that meant so much to me.  As they say, when one door closes another one opens, and it does.

I do think that pastor should reconsider his support and involvement with the Barnabus Center because he doesn’t know the first thing about brokenness.  If he does, then what he did to me makes it that much worse.",2 years ago
Jack Notarangelo, 5 stars ,"Spent the weekend in Charlotte on business and sought out a PCA church to attend and found Uptown Church. I’m so glad I did. Was welcomed by loving brothers and sisters, the gospel was proclaimed to God’s glory, the worship team was superb playing mostly traditional hymns with a smattering of contemporary songs. Loved my time with these people worshipping the Lord Jesus together.",3 years ago
