Sharon E Coleman, 5 stars ,"Beautiful church and property. Sadly, I was there for a funeral but I was truly grateful for the hospitality and the love the Pinelands Presbyterian Church showed us during the homegoing services for Kathyleen Franklin. May your church and it's congregation prosper abundantly! Thank you Pastor Parker, Elder Cooper and the Pinelands church family!",3 years ago

Brenda Elizabeth Rocha, 1 star ,"I signed up two children's for summer camp and cancer before it even started. They keep 95 dollars for each child, where everywhere else they keep a sign up fee of 15 or 30 dollars. Tell me how is this fair, is a shame you go to this places looking for help and advice and you get rip off.",3 years ago
