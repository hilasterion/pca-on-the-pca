Rachel P, 1 star ,"We visited and did not feel welcome at all. First, no one said hello or opened the door for our stroller. An older man was walking us to the nursery and passed by the pastor. He told him to “go speak with a nice couple around the corner looking for a new church.” Clearly my family is not the type the church is looking for. We left without anyone saying anything.",3 years ago
