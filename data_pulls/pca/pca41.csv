Alanna, 5 stars ,"We joined this church in 2013 (6 years now) and have been blessed to have pastors preach the gospel. This church is blessed with many wonderful families and little children. A great place to gather and worship as one body whether you are new to the city, a student, a young family, empty-nesters or just passing through.",2 years ago

Shardae Carter, 5 stars ,"I’m Gonna Be Honest! This Church Is Amazing! I Put Up A Bad Review Because I Was Angry & Going Through Something! I Ask That God Forgive Me I Was Wrong! The Deacons At This Church Are Very Nice! They Listen & Understands Others Issues & Help Them Resolve Them! This Was The First Church Me And My Boyfriend Stopped At Coming From Chicago! They Hepled Us Every Step Of The Way Until We Got Into The Couples Shelter Zaban Paradise Center. They Didn’t Have To Do That But They Went Over The Extrem! God Bless You All!!! This Church Deserves 10 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
