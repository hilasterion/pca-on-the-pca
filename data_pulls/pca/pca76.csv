Gene Ownbey, 5 stars ,"My wife and I had a wonderful Christ-focused worship service while on vacation.  The people were warm, welcoming, and friendly.  The service was well thought out from the worship songs to the prayer time and Scripture reading. The sermon was Scripture driven and faithful to the text.  I would highly recommend this family of faith.",2 weeks ago

Tirique Henry, 5 stars ,"We just passed your church with a large crowd and not one person had on a mask.
We were looking for a church, but I can assure you my family will not be joining a church that has such little regulars for the welfare of other in this time.",2 years ago
Dylan Gouletas, 5 stars ,"We share your concern about COVID safety.  This is why we have posted the CDC precautions, make face masks and sanitizer available, have widened our seating, temporarily canceled Sunday School and eating functions, temporary closed our nursery, and made a live TV feed available in our fellowship hall if needed for parents with small children.  The event you saw with people outside was an event from a community group who requested to use our facility.  We recommended to them to follow the CDC guidelines as precautions. May the Lord bless you in finding a church that will encourage you and your family in your walk with God.",4 years ago
