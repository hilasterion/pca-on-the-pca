Shirley Simmons, 5 stars ,"I Rate It Five Stars Because It's A Church Family That's Awesome To Be In And Around. MNC Is An Amazing Fellowship With Each Other. The Word Of God Is There Being Preached And Teach By Some Great Men Of God Pastor Howard, Associate Pastor John And ElderTodd (In Training) They Each Allows God To Use Them To Speak A Word In Season And Out Of Season. We Have The Best Youths And Young Children That's Willing And Able To Work For God. I Would Invite Anyone To Come See For Themselves. Once You Get A Taste Of What Happening At MNC, You Won't Be The Same. Our Music Ministry Is Off The Chain (Just A Figure Of Speech) I Love It, They Ushers The Spirit Of God In There, They Ushers The Spirit Of God Before The Spoken Word Of God And After The Word Of God. Beautiful Fellowship With The Different Ministries!!! This Is Just A Taste Of What's Happening Here At MNC!!! In St.John 1:46 Phillip Told Nathanael,""To Come And See"" For Yourself And I'm Saying The Same Thing ""Come And See!!!"" Lots Of Love And God Bless 😀❤️❤️❤️🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽👍🏽",6 years ago
