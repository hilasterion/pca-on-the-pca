James Caudill, 5 stars ,"Cornerstone stays true to the word with expositional teaching.  The people are genuine and full of love.  Bo is a fine pastor who goes above and beyond to aid everyone in the congregation in their spiritual growth and provides keen guidance.  This is my first church home and I've been looking for about 15 years!
