Andre Mackey, 2 stars ,"I visited Downtown Pres. yesterday 6/2 with the hope of finding a refromed congregation, I was sadly mistaken. They start service very early in the morning at about 8:30 because I guess they have other things more important than worshiping the Triune God of Justice on a Sabbath morning. They do not have hymn book and they mix newer hymns with others hymns which is nice and refreshing. But the part that made me sick was when they dismissed the children to the unbiblical Children's Church, I did ask out loud, ""Aren't these children part of the covenant?"" I was not answered, therefore the answer is no. This is a church that says presbyterian but they have no idea what it means to be a covenant member of the Lords Church. They did have wine with their communion but they pushed us through like cattle. I will not be returning, mainly because this is a country club not a Church of the most High. No one greeted me or asked me my name. I wipe my feet of their sin.",3 years ago
