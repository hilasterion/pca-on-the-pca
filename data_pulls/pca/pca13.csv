Monte White, 5 stars ,The first visit had the best Advent sermon I've heard. Plan to return several times to confirm my assessment of personal faith matching church's united faith. I will be changing current church affiliation to another in the future.,11 months ago
JT J, 5 stars ,"BobbyWhitley, not sure which “Hope Church” you visited, (there are several named that in WS,) but it wasn’t this one.  People are “REAL” and genuine and it is a beautiful building where the free grace of Jesus is preached every week.",3 years ago
