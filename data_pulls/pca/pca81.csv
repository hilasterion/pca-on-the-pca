Barry Joye, 5 stars ,"Almost nine years ago we heard about Faith Presbyterian though a friend and decided our family would visit.  We made the drive from Lake City, FL and have made it ever since.
The people are warm and genuine; love and truth are taught and lived; there is a wonderful diversity of people...especially with the surrounding Universities and there are plenty of opportunities to engage your
gifts in the body.
Yes, we would highly recommend this church.",4 years ago
Andre Gaboriau, 5 stars ,"My wife and I love this church. We were greeted by church members and immediately felt welcomed, the preacher preaches gospel-centered messages, and everybody is accepting of discussion. Whether it's your first time visiting a church or you are a lifetime church-goer, I recommend checking out Faith Presbyterian. I'd love to see you there!",5 years ago
Tyler Walker, 5 stars ,"This is where I worship on Sunday's. I believe Faith is a welcoming place with honest people. The stated mission of the church is to make disciples by engaging God's world, equipping God's people, and exalting God. Come worship with us on Sunday's at 10am!",4 years ago
