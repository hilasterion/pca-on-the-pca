R Scott Ferson, 5 stars ,This is a small Church seats about 120 including the balcony area. The folks are very friendly here. The service here starts in the morning at 10:15 a.m. and continues to 11:30 ish. The congregation is always gathered outside on the lawn after church. So if you're in the mood to socialize mood this is the place to be .,4 months ago
Miranda Jatindranath, 5 stars ,"My husband and I have been members for well over a year now and the church just continues to bless us more and more. Sound, biblical teachings that provoke thought, repentance, and spur us on to pursue more Christ-likeness and deeper communion with the Lord. Wonderful community with members of all ages and many, many children in the church (with new additions weekly, it seems ðŸ˜‰). There are childrenâ€™s ministries for all ages, Bible studies, and other various things to get involved in throughout the week. Highly recommend this wonderful church!",8 months ago
Zachary Linn, 5 stars ,"I've grown up in this church and can't say enough great things about the pastor. Good meaty sermons. Not your fluffy, health and wealth, no actual biblical content sermons you see so often.
The youth ministry has REALLY grown in recent years and is becoming a great outreach for the community. Also, the praise band is fantastic!!!!... and I'm not just saying that because I play mandolin in the band or anything.",6 years ago
Stefan Makarov, 5 stars ,"Ever since my family and I moved to FWB 7 years ago we have not stop coming to this church. God Spirit abides in minds and hearts of families that attend WPC, which in turn creates an invironment that is healthy for spiritual growth, and truly underlines scripture when Christ said ""by your love toward each other people shall know that you are my disciples"" this is the picture of that here in this family oriented, doctrine based and heart for outreach church:)",5 years ago
