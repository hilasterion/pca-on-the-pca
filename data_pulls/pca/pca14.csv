Megan Wilson, 5 stars ,"We (my husband, toddler son, and I) started attending Salem Pres just over 2 years ago, when I considered myself agnostic/atheist. I was immediately drawn in to Ben Milner's preaching style- as a former atheist himself, his sermons are always informative and expository, and always making the case FOR the historicity and truth of the scriptures. The Gospel is shared during every service- clearly, accurately, and in a way that helps all to better understand who we are, who God is, and the nature of the great exchange on the cross. As you can probably tell, I've since become a Christian- about a year after we began attending services. I'm positive that God used this church to bring me to faith.

Other aspects of Salem Pres that I find distinctive:
-We take the Lord's Supper each and every week, however there isn't any pressure to partake if you do not believe.
-People confess and repent in front of each other, and in front of the entire congregation at times; I had never experienced this level of honesty and openness in a church before.
-Worship services are varied and eclectic, but NOT like a rock concert- more intimate and ""stripped down,"" if you will.
-Our congregation is relatively small, which means it is easy to meet people, and many congregants (and definitely pastors) will know you by name quickly.
-Church services are kid friendly- don't be surprised to hear kids cry, squeal, babble, etc. during church. The church believes that children start picking up on things passively much earlier than we give them credit for- as with language development- so we should expose them to the gospel and church liturgies from a young age.
-We have additional, and even more intimate, opportunities to make connections, including small groups, bible studies, monthly brunches, potluck dinners, and church membership classes, as well as other church events.",5 years ago
Denise Hiller, 5 stars ,"We joined Salem Pres when we returned to Winston-Salem for my husband's residency in 2011. In fact, one of the initial reasons we started attending Salem was due to the 5pm service time, which is convenient for my husband who often works or is getting off of work on Sunday mornings. There are lots of medical families and students who attend. I love the worship time which is led by different (very talented!) members each week - so there is a variety of styles from more contemporary to classic hymns. Dress is casual though you'll find people more dressed-up as well. The preaching is excellent and is more Biblical exposition than self-help. It always points to the Gospel, and to the communion table, which is an important part of the service each week.

Children are included in the service, and though caring childcare is available, many children stay in church for part or all of the time. Children may come to the front for a joyful and heartwarming dancing session during the final song of the service. As a parent, I love that I feel comfortable nursing in the service or having my baby squeal without embarrassment, but I imagine the baby noise could be disconcerting at first for visitors without kids.

We have become very involved with the church community and there are lots of ways to do so- through home fellowship groups, bible studies & prayer times, and service opportunities (particularly in the West Salem neighborhood). If you're reading this I hope you will come visit soon!",7 years ago
Anne Glenn, 5 stars ,"My husband and I joined Salem almost 2 years ago (in 2012) and have loved our community here.  We first decided to join because we thought the sermons were enlightening, enriching, and full of truth.  Ben Milner, the senior teaching pastor, has the wonderful ability to combine intellect and faith, and he constantly challenges us to analyze ourselves and how we view Christianity.  We have embedded ourselves within the Salem community now, and I can't recommend this church more.  Its honesty is appealing and welcoming to all.",8 years ago
Kim Watkins, 5 stars ,"We started attending Salem Pres in 2009, and joined a small group the following year. This community has supported, challenged and encouraged us through a number of life stages. The sermon series tend to follow whole books of the bible and always celebrate the good news of Gods great grace to sinful people. We celebrate the Lord's Supper regularly (each week). We love this church and feel blessed to call Salem home!",6 years ago
Ben Magee, 5 stars ,"It's awesome, and a welcoming place if you're looking for strong community within your church. I've been going for about five months now and it continues to get better because everyone is friendly so it's easy to meet more and more good people. Pastors are personable, funny and knowledgeable - and seek to really get to know each member of their congregation. The worship is awesome as well - a lot of talented musicians.",7 years ago
Hayes Wauford, 5 stars ,"Amy and I began attending Salem in January of 2012 and have been at home there ever since. We joined in December 2012. Ben Milner is an amazing pastor- his sermons are convicting and uplifting as he stays true to the Word and reminds us weekly of Jesus' death and resurrection to forgive our sins. Austin Pfeiffer, Associate Pastor, brings a great passion for outreach and service to the church and together Ben and Austin, along with the Elders, serve both the spiritual and physical needs of the church body and West Salem neighborhood.

Amy and I, and now our son Hayes, have felt welcomed into this community from the beginning and I would highly recommend to anyone searching for a church home!",8 years ago
Laura Denlinger, 5 stars ,"We started attending Salem Pres about 2 years ago after moving to Winston Salem. We immediately felt at home. Community is such an important part of the experience at Salem Pres. We joined a Home Fellowship Group right away and started to made deeper connections to the church. We are so happy to be raising our family in such a loving, Christ-centered church.",8 years ago
Sean McNamara, 5 stars ,"I started attending this church in fall 2009 when I did not believe in God.  At the time I suppose I would call myself an agnostic.  I was exploring Christianity and I had a lot of questions.  I found pastor Ben Milner's preaching style very refreshing and very challenging (in a good way).  I should note that I grew up very cynical about religion, especially Christianity.  I appreciated Ben's preaching style right off the bat because he is very humble, often times confessing his own short comings, not putting himself up on a pedestal.  His concern when preaching is Jesus Christ and the Gospel and the implications that has for us as humans.  He also has a tremendous gift for explaining really difficult passages in ways that everyone can understand.  He is a former atheist so it made it easy for me to personally relate to him and I feel like he understands what it means to struggle with faith.  He does not paint the Christian faith in a fairy tale light where everything is perfect 100% of the time.  He is realistic, but always comes back around to pointing to the hope that is in Jesus.

The church community was/is extremely welcoming and not in a superficial kind of way.  I could tell that there was something more to the hospitality of the church body than merely trying to ""put on a show"".  I didn't feel like people were being nice to me just because they wanted me to keep coming back so they could feel good about themselves.  I could sense that there was something deeper and profound behind their kindness.

I came to faith maybe 4 or 5 months after I started attending and became a member soon after my conversion.  I have been a member ever since.  I mention that not to say that if you visit Salem Pres Ben Milner and the church community are going to instantly make your life perfect and all of your problems will vanish and God will make total sense to you.  But I will definitely say that God used this church to bring me to faith and I believe that part of the reason how that was accomplished was/is because of their palpable faith in God and not in themselves.  Everything this church does strives to point to God as the source of salvation and nothing else.

I also don't want to portray this church as a church just for people who are unbelievers.  This church is for anyone, believers and non believers alike who desire to know God.  The church body contains a wide variety of people who are both new to the faith, lifetime believers, and nonbelievers looking for answers.

If you are looking for a church or just curious about Christianity I would definitely recommend a visit.",7 years ago
Rachael Schmid, 5 stars ,"I started attending Salem when I was a Wake Forest student, about three years ago. I was immediately drawn in by the peace of this place and these people. Many seasons later, this is still where I come for peace â€” and to learn and to cry and to be reminded of truth. Salem is a group of literal neighbors, of teachers, and of friends. When I stepped onto Wake's campus as a freshman six years ago, I couldn't have imagined a church would be the reason I'd stick around in Winston-Salem. But here we are.",7 years ago
Douglas Williams, 5 stars ,"A young church with lots of families and college students, very open and eager to engage new people. The musicianship is top notch and the preaching never disappoints.",2 years ago
