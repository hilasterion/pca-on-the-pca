Jennifer Smith, 5 stars ,"We are very happy to find this hidden gem of Reformed teaching! Currently sharing a sanctuary in the Seventh Day Adventist church, there isn't usually an indication of Riverside's weekly presence. Riverside offers solid biblical teaching unmatched in this area. Definitely worth seeking out.",3 years ago
Amanda Black, 5 stars ,This church felt like home the first Sunday I was here. The preaching is biblical and awesome. Everyone is so nice. We love visitors and you're especially welcome at our fourth Sunday potluck that happens after the service about 12:30.,3 years ago
