Rakib Avi, 5 stars ,A great community of very supportive people. We were invited to a church get together by one of the members of the community and everyone was super friendly! They are open to people of all faiths as long as everyone is respectful towards others.,a year ago
Tryggvi McDonald, 5 stars ,The pastor is a very nice guy who is competent in his preaching and has a solid theological understanding. He knows how to appeal to those in attendance while also welcoming newer believers. The music is also impressive. It complements the worship and hymns without overwhelming and becoming the centerpiece. I would highly recommend this church to anyone.,a year ago
Andrew Gross, 5 stars ,"This is a fantastic church with a very sound doctrine. If you Are looking for something more traditional and less of what the mega churches have the offer, this is the perfect place for you. They greeted me warmly when I arrived. They introduced themselves. They helped me get involved with community groups that they had to offer. The music was intimate and sweet. The pastor who preached did a fantastic job keeping the congregation interested. I will continue to return to this place because it is truly what my heart needed.",4 years ago
Josh Roberts, 5 stars ,"I love my home church. High liturgical worship (call to worship, confession of sin, assurance of forgiveness); musicians are very talented and the music is beautiful, but the emphasis is on the congregation singing together rather than having star performers. Communion and  membership are open to those acknowledging their sin and confessing their need and reliance on Christ as a savior. Church life includes two large annual picnics with live music, an emphasis on weekly small group participation, various Sunday School and youth groups, partnership with the local RUF chapter for college ministry, and elders who shepherd and care for those in church membership. Teaching emphasis is expository. Pastors work on exegesis and the whole of scripture rather than topical sermons or weekly themes.",3 years ago
