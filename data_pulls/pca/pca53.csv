R L, 5 stars ,"A welcoming church with a lot of young families. The founding pastor, Randy is a gifted teacher and there is a super talented worship band that plays mostly contemporary music. A robust children’s care and teaching program for all ages, and a great network of small groups for deeper study. Inspiring ministry.",3 years ago
