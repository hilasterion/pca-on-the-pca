Kate Schell, 5 stars ,"I was initially drawn to Christ Church Intown because of their commitment to the gospel, wonderful teaching, relatively small size, diversity, vulnerability and passion for serving the local community.  I also really enjoy the way they marry the rich Presbyterian liturgy with spontaneous, spirit-filled worship.  Since joining and beginning to serve in the church, I have grown to love the church even more!  People are kind and real. I've been challenged, I've grown and I'm excited to be part of a church family that bridges racial, economic and all other kinds of divides.",4 years ago
Jim Moore, 5 stars ,"This congregation is a very wonderful friendship community. And pastor Dave is very adept in explaining the everyday Christian lifestyle straight from God's Holy Word. We give praise and worship to our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ, and are reminded to take that message of his love with us as we leave each and every Sunday. I feel really blessed that he loves us so much that he shed his blood for our sins. I invite everyone to come by and visit with us any Sunday at 10a.m. and experience God's love.
May God bless you all in a special way today!",4 years ago
Todd Bishop, 5 stars ,The people are welcoming. Pastor Dave is “real” and speaks good biblical truth in a way that I can relate to each week. The diversity of people from all walks of life makes this church have great character and joy. My kids and whole family love it here!,4 years ago
Catherine Driscoll, 5 stars ,"A very welcoming and diverse church. Sound and provocative preaching with practical application. Soul strengthening praise and worship music. I believe InTown is a picture of what heaven will look like. I felt at home the moment I walked into the sanctuary. The church meets at the City Rescue Mission on McDuff.
Come visit!",4 years ago
Juli Catlin, 5 stars ,"Love this kind and welcoming community of Christ. Dave Abney is a gifted minister, who speaks from his heart and when a verse or chapter is studied he always weaves the history and context of the verse into his sermon. I have learned a great deal from his sermons. And they live with me all week on my journey to be more like Christ. A fun church with seasonal lunches on the lawn and other fun activities.
Lots of young families and kids of all ages.",4 years ago

Rob Barnickel, 5 stars ,"We moved from NYC to JAX in 2014 and this was the first church on our list of PCA churches to check out. We were attending a Tim Keller / Redeemer plant in NYC so this church and pastor had a tough act to follow, but after attending a few services we were sold. In a city where we have no other family, this church has become our family.",4 years ago
Leslie Bishop, 5 stars ,"CCIT has fantastic preaching, stands true to God’s word, and has a loving cross-cultural community.

ben kodatt, 5 stars ,"I have been going to this church since it first started.  I am amazed every Sunday, the church is truly about sharing the word of God to all people, no matter where you are in life.  If you are looking to worship at a church that truly cares about you no matter what, then come this Sunday at 10am!",4 years ago
