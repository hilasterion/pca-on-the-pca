Adam Whitlow, 1 star ,"After 4 years I'm over this place. They are supposed to be my neighbor and a place of peace and worship. Instead they have been dishonest and misleading regarding their side hustle in renting their gymnasium to a very loud wanna be ""mega church"". The previous tenant had very loud parties until 4AM! I have never witnessed such blatant disrespect and dishonesty towards neighbors, all for an extra dollar. The tenants thump loud music on average 8+ hours a week and neither party really cares about the surrounding residential community. They have lied to us for years and I have no more patience for them. If I could rate zero stars I would. We have voiced our concerns on numerous occasions and they had their chance to remedy the situation.",7 months ago
Eleni Mantis, 1 star ,"After multiple complaints and meetings, this church and it’s leadership has proven that they are inconsiderate of their neighbors. They have no respect for the neighborhood. There is constant noise and loud music that can be heard until the wee hours of the night. Not to mention the fact that they seem to be exempt from Governor‘s orders and restrictions by continuing to have services and large gatherings while the rest of the state was abiding by the rules of the Stay-At-Home order. Ridiculous!",2 years ago

John Georgopoulos, 1 star ,"This church does not care for or respect the neighborhood they are in.
