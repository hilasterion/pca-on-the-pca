Debbie C, 5 stars ,"A traditional, formal PCA Presbyterian church. Songs sung from Hymnals. The pastor is an excellent teacher, and is spot on with his teachings. You won't be mislead here. If you can't handle the truth, then Second Presbyterian is not for you",10 months ago

Brendon Branigin, 5 stars ,"We attended last Fall when we visited Greenville. Now we are making our way thru the area again and are returning to Greenville on the weekend specifically to attend church there again and ride the Swamp Rabbit Trail. Two reasons to return to the great little town of Greenville. We love St. Andrews Chapel in Sanford, FL and this is much like that on a smaller scale.",2 years ago
