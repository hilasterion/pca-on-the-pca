David & Julie Dyer, 5 stars ,This is a wonderful church! It's firmly anchored on solid theology and the pastor is amazing at conveying that. His ability to not only preach the word but his concise and detailed teaching of how to apply it to your day to day life is unparalleled!,8 months ago
Jules Dyer, 5 stars ,This is a lovely church. The church itself is small & the congregation is full of many wonderful people who will make you feel very welcome. You won't feel overwhelmed as one might feel walking into a megachurch. The church is more of a family & the service & teaching is Christ centered. I love the people here as well as the teaching.,3 years ago
Dwayne Harmon, 5 stars ,"A Bible believing, teaching, and preaching church that is loving and welcoming. My wife and I attended worship there over seven months ago and we knew no one in the church when we walked in the first time. The people at Westminster showed the heart of Christ to my wife and I. They acknowledge the depravity of man and the Doctrines of Grace. Christ and the Gospel is at the center of all preaching and teaching and is the mission of the church. My wife and I became members of Westminster Presbyterian in February by God's providential grace and His mercy. We are grateful our Lord brought us to this church.",6 years ago
Louis William Rose, 5 stars ,"Well this is my church so you know how I feel. If you want the truth come here, if you want your ears  tickled go somewhere else. Drop in the second Sunday of the month and have lunch with us on the grounds. Great people, great pastor. We all know we are terrible sinners and hypocrites, so you'll fit right in!",3 years ago
