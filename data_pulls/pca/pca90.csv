Jordan Johnson, 5 stars ,I‚Äôve been going here for a few year. I first started going here to meet some nice people and I found a family. I sometimes think what is life about but so many people from the ave remind me in their own way that it‚Äôs about serving our lord.,6 months ago
Rafael Adams, 5 stars ,"Amazing Sunday service.  This church is community oriented.  They do events all year, have small groups and an awesome pastor that speaks true word.  It's easy to get involved.  Don't forget to mention bagels with spreads, pastries and hot or iced coffee.  Check it out.  I think you will walk away feeling refreshed.",2 years ago

Sean Klein, 5 stars ,"Almost four years ago I arrived at the Avenue Church on a bicycle with a new, uncultivated faith in Jesus Christ. I didn't have a family growing up in state-run facilities as an orphan and ward of the state, and I had never experienced a Church that truly embodied the loving community that the Bible seemed to point to. The Avenue Church has helped me to continually grow in faith and understanding of God's Word, has enabled me to grow into my spiritual gifts, given me outlets to express my love for God and fellowship with others who do, and does not stifle the Word of God or His Holy Spirit. It is a Church that is on mission to reach those who many might consider 'unlovable, unwanted, too-far-gone,' without exclusion. That first day at the Ave I found a home and now have brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles.. I don't have to do life and faith alone anymore. You don't either-- come and see!",11 months ago
