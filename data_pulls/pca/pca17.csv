Aaron Belz, 5 stars ,"Terrific community--no wonder it's growing so quickly. For us, the City Group (weeknight) meeting has been just as valuable as the Sunday morning teaching and worship.  Very loving, biblically-oriented church. I've been attending since its first service 4 years ago.",4 years ago
