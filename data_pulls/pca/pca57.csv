U. Chinedu Amaefula, 5 stars ,"A very regal church with classical wooden pews, and antiquitous stained glass Christian themed windows. A time capsule of sorts for the 21st century.",2 months ago
Jeff & Diana Dean, 5 stars ,"Was visiting family and decided to worship here. Worshipful and vibrant. I visited Sunday school as well as attended the late service. People seemed to enjoy great community, but sadly they ignored me the Sunday I visited. I praise God though for allowing me to attend the worshipful service there",9 months ago
Andrew Sandberg, 1 star ,"Had enough money to order over $1100 worth of food for an event, but only tip $20. Tithe 10% tip 2% ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",4 weeks ago
Jeff LaGro, 5 stars ,"We wanted a more traditional service in a smaller beautiful church, with great pastors & this feels like home.
3 pastors serve this PCA church, with a true heart for God's Word.
The congregation sings beautiful hymns, accompanied by piano & strings. What a joy to be here.",a year ago
Matt Michaud, 5 stars ,"Solid Biblical preaching, a healthy dose of liturgy, engaging and relevant worship music, alongside a friendly and welcoming congregation all make for an excellent worship service every Sunday. Highly recommend for anyone serious about encountering the risen Christ on Sunday morning!",2 years ago
Nashville Fun, 5 stars ,"Pretty place. Much more traditional church service and hymn's for Sunday. People were okay, not very friendly, but not rude. Mostly just interested in talking to each other instead of meeting the new person, so not bad. Just may take a couple of visits to make a connection with other people going there.",2 years ago
Steve Consultant, 5 stars ,"Good preaching, a warm and friendly church where God is glorified.  Quite formal in style.",4 years ago
