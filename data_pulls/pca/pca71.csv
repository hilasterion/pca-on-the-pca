Mary Jo Middleton Williams, 1 star ,"Liked service order, music was good - traditional and contemporary and  there was great use of scripture.  Congregation had young and older people in congregation s sign of growing families. 20 joined church today  = awesome.  One person spoke to us in total visit.  When I asked for the fellowship hall afterwards to meet the pastor and members the doors we were directed to were locked.  Went back a second time to ask for fellowship hall, no one directed us to the room, but we found it.  No one spoke in this room either and could not get access to pastors even after we stood in a very short line. We finally just left.  We are new to the area and long to be apart of the body of Christ.",a year ago
Gregory Kent, 5 stars ,Great family church in a quaint close setting. It's small enough to know everyone and large enough to have a great youth and children's program. The teaching is very sound. The fellowship is great and we love being a part!,4 years ago
