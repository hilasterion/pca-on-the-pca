Daniel Santos Jr, 5 stars ,"(Translated by Google) One of the best Presbyterian churches in this area of Chattanooga. Pay attention to a curious fact: there are two services that take place simultaneously, in different places and with different preachers. One is in a more contemporary style (which to many will still seem conservative) and the other is very conservative. I participated without knowing the most contemporary. Excellent message. Don't forget to pick up the free booklets on departure. Excellent material produced by CCEF.

(Original)
Uma das melhores opções de igrejas presbiterianas nessa região de Chattanooga.  Atente para um fato curioso: há dois cultos que acontecem simultaneamente, em locais diferentes e com pregadores diferentes. Um deles é num estilo mais contemporâneo (o que para muitos ainda parecerá conservador) e o outro bem conservador. Participei sem saber do mais contemporâneo. Excelente mensagem. Não se esqueça de pegar os livretos gratuitos na saída. Excelente material produzido pelo CCEF.",4 months ago
