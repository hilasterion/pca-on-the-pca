Andrew L, 5 stars ,"This is the place to be on Sunday morning if you're a Christian (or even if you're not).  They still hold fast to their young, hip roots, even though they have a morning service instead of an evening one now.  However, it is a church full of sinners, so don't go if you're perfect or looking for perfect people.

In fact, some of them even disagree with each other about things.

If you're looking to experience Christ with other people who believe that he was a real person who actually was/is the son of God, then show up at 10am on Sunday morning.

Actually, show up at 9:50 so you don't walk in late and have everyone turn to stare at you.

EDIT: You don't have to be a Christian to show up.",6 years ago
