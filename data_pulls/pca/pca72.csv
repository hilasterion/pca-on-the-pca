Choose kindness, 3 stars ,Nice Church good service Pastor was on point. I like the facility it was very clean the downside would be the snooty congregation that did not seem open to visitors. But I believe in the house of God as long as you are hearing the word that's what matters. They did not make me feel guilty at donation time so I was willing to donate or tied my money I would say that I learned from the service from the teachings of the preacher or his reading of the Gospel I should say and would recommend families give it a try as long as you don't mind putting up with a few snooty people in a they are everywhere it's not a bad Church.,4 years ago
Bryant Meredith, 5 stars ,"Great church if you're in Mobile and need to hear a gospel message. The pastor is the best you could ever ask for. Be advised this is by no means a Presbyterian church, WHATSOEVER. They've identified with the PCA, but they'd do better to go non-denominational because that's what they are. My wife and I prefer a more historically orthodox and liturgical church, so we left, but that was totally a choice of aesthetics.",7 years ago
