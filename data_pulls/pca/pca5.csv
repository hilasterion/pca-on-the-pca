Vanessa King, 5 stars ,Sovereign Grace has been an integral part of my deepening faith and relationship with the Lord. We attended for 6 years before we moved and we will miss it dearly. The Pastors are theologically sound and provide deep teaching that makes you looking forward to worship the following Sunday. We will miss SGPC very much.,2 years ago
T P, 5 stars ,"A wonderful church.  A genuine passion for the Lord and His gospel.  Meaty Christ exalting preaching and passionate prayers.  A sober minded  joy in worship.  A reverence for the Word of God.  Scripture saturated Sunday mornings.  An amazing pastoral team and a new addition in Rob Dykes.  Its been such a blessing to sit under the preaching of these men.  The church, its leaders and everything they do is so obviously for the glory of God.  Traditional worship and service structure but never a stuffy, self righteous, judgmental air.  Instantly felt like a body of believers that love the Lord and each other.  Very happy to have been led here and looking forward to membership and settling in a permanent church home.",5 years ago
