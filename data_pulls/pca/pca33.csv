Tracey Perdue, 5 stars ,"This is my “home” church where I grew up, and my parents still go. I visit any time I’m back in town, and I love seeing all the friendly faces- some new and some old. The reason why this church shines is because of it’s heart. The pastor and the people really care about others and have a giving heart to everyone around them. They are thoughtful in all that they do in making sure that they speak and preach the Bible accurately and with humility. They live out their faith too - they aren’t just talk. All walks of life are accepted here. The services lean towards the traditional style of hymns and the sermons are deeply steeped in theology, yet are applicable to life. Pastor Mark has a quirky sense of humor and helps you feel at ease. This is an excellent church that clearly loves Jesus!",8 months ago
